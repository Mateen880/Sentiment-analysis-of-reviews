If you love southern style cuisine (collards, fried chicken & waffles, etc), you’ll love K &K. The kitchen was slow, but the food was great once it arrived. Our servers were pleasant but clearly the restaurant was understaffed during our visit. Beautiful and interesting crowd turned up on a Sunday midday."

So we sat at the bar after about 45 minutes of waiting we ordered a drink. An hour and 30 minutes later we were asked by others who were waiting if we had made reservations as well. Fortunately the beautiful bartender overheard the conversations and she spoke to the manager finally we were seated. We were even told we only   1.5 hours to dine but the food took so long to come that the waitress advised that we could take our time. Needless to say my reservation request was not made, we ordered a 2nd round of drinks that never came , I could go on and on but this was not good. I will try kitchen and kocktails in Charlotte NC because I refuse to believe this establishment is undeserving of another chance to get it right. Best of wishes to you all!"

We explained that we needed to leave by 7:30 to make an event, so we were only ordering appetizers:. 2 orders of fried green tomatoes, 1 deviled egg order, 1 bowl of gumbo.  She said that she would inform the kitchen but that given what we ordered, it wouldn’t be an issue. The food did not arrive to the table until 7:11.\n\nThe food was delish and with a better overall experience, it could have been amazing. The FGT were cut way too thick, but everything tasted great.\n\nThe noise level was ridiculous. We literally were yelling at each other across the table. Literally. The ambience was a missed opportunity. It looked like a lot of time and effort was put into making the restaurant “IG ready,” but no thought to the fact that the chairs were too wide for two of them to fit on one side of a table that was meant for 4 people. The fact that you had to scream to hear your table-mates was so annoying. …such a disappointment.\n\nWould I go back?  Yes, for the food. Would I go back during any period of the day when others would be there (brunch, weekend dinner, happy hour)?  Absolutely not."

Sides are $11 each, grits, eggs, etc. Surf & Turf was excellent. Patron Margarita $37 in fancy bottle glass. You don’t keep the glass. I ordered eggs, waiter forgot to add them so no eggs. I ordered coffee. First brunch ever that did not have coffee. Drinks took longer than expected. 2 people. 20 minutes before the 90 minute max table time, waiter returns for payment. We could go to the lounge if we wanted to hang out longer and finish our drinks. Brunch $254.80. Included 20% “fees and charges”. Waiter asked if I wanted to tip. I said I just did. He said  not technically because the 20% fees and charges is split among the staff. I’m sorry but I am not paying another 20% “gratuity”."

I generally tip more than 20% , at my last outing I tipped 50%  I understand the thought process but I like it to be my choice to tip for GREAT service. Will definitely return"

It began with the valet being MIA for 20 minutes when we pulled up… come to find out he was sitting somewhere in a car… We finally get into the restaurant and we are seated 20 minutes before anyone comes to greet us at the table. After we order drinks we have to wave the server back over to the table to take our orders. I asked for a medium steak and it came out (30 mins later) cold and (very) well done... couldn’t find the waitress to send it back so had to flag down someone else for help. I asked for plain waffles and they came out with some type of caramel drizzle and powdered sugar... they were sent back and it took another 30 minutes for them to come back out. I asked for eggs scrambled WITH cheddar and they came out in a bowl scrambled with some cheddar sprinkled on the top (not throughout). Kept having to chase down the waitress because she was posted at the bar for our entire meal... for a meal that cost over $300, that should NOT have been the experience. Also they have some sort of service charge that is already factored in and with service like this, I should have been able to control what I paid for the service I received.\n-1 star experience.\nWould NOT recommend."

The food arrived after 40 minutes from being ordered and was lukewarm at best. They were put of bread puddinh The seafood gumbo had no shrimp and one small crab leg. No other seafood and mostly chunks of sausage. It was very loud with tables with bright ring lights and lots of people blocking staircase to take photos. It seemed most people were interested in taking photos at their tables even if their flash was blinding people at other tables. Even with two people, they charge a service and fees of 20%, when we asked if this was a tip for our waiter, our waiter was very evasive and felt saying he was not sure if he would actually receive any and unclear how much he would get. He told us of we wanted to tip him, we would have to leave an additional amount on top of the 20% fee since that goes to the entire behind scenes staff as in servers snd cooks. There was no working bathroom upstairs as it was under construction. The downstairs bathroom was disgusting.  It was dripping from the ceiling in everywhere; completely slippery and dangerous. The toilet did not flush. \n\nIn sum, disgusting women’s bathroom, lukewarm food, seafood gumbo with no seafood, 40+ minute wait for food, 25 minute wait even with reservation, 40% of taxes/servuce charge/tip (10% tax, 20% service/fees charge,10% just to your specific staff)."

The table we were seated at for 5 was very uncomfortable and truly not large enough to suit more than 2 people comfortably. Me and my daughter sat on the ends of the table and literally was forced with dresses on to sit uncomfortably with a table leg in between our legs during dinner. Then my husband was seated on the end of the table so we were all bumping knees. This also caused our  dinner place for the plate of dinner to not be immediately in front of us and was so uncomfortable. The food was delicious and our waiter Rafael was amazing, but the table sizes in relation to the seating used is not sufficient. The table itself is just too small. I wish that didn't negatively tant our experience, but it did. For the amount spent for the dinner and the ambiance of the restaurant, my party expected a better, more comfortable seating experience to enjoy our visit. My back literally started hurting from the awkward cramped seating. Please do better. Thank you."

I Arrived at 1:40 PM, my reservations were for 1:45 then I was told there was a 15 minute wait because they were running a little behind, but was not seated until 2:45 so clearly they were way overbooked!!! While I was waiting to be seated, I visited the bar and ordered a double shot of patron where the bartender proceeded to pour me the  last bit ￼of an almost empty Don Julio reposado bottle which she charged me $54 for. I paid the $54 and also left a tip even though I was unsatisfied, she was very busy being as though it was Howard’s homecoming weekend. After my drink, I proceeded to go to the restroom upstairs where the restroom was blocked off. Once we were finally seated, I asked was there a bathroom downstairs so I proceeded to the downstairs bathroom where the ceiling was leaking and the floor was completely wet. I’ve then went back to my table where the table was dirty and no menus were given or QR codes for us to look at a menu so we had to wait for someone to walk past our table to get us a waiter and a boy. Before we ordered our food, I asked for a manager to come, so I could give him the rundown on how my experience had been so far. He let us know that he apologized for the service and that he would give us a discount and he also gave us three drinks on the house.. everything was great after that. The food was good. The service was good and once I had finished drinking my frozen margarita, I realized that what I thought was a chunk of ice at the bottom of my frozen drink was an old receipt inside of my drink, totally ruined my whole experience. It was the worst EVER! I tried to get a picture of it, but the manager was trying to hide the bottle behind his back, but another young lady sent me a video of it. The manager did give me a 30% off discount, but I was not satisfied after the receipt found in my drink and wanted a full refund! I was refunded, but it wasn’t worth the experience. The worst"

We were assured that it was ok and was greeted politely upon arrival. They were ALL so kind... in spite of EVERYTHING going wrong.\nIt was VERY crowded. We waited an hour to be seated. The crowd varied with multiple generations. Dress code: from sweat shirts to prom dresses. Shots were given out to accommodate the waiting crowd.\nWe sat after nearly an hour of waiting. Our obviously overwhelmed waitress explained that the kitchen was backed up (allegedly 30 minutes) and suggested we put our orders in all at once. After sitting for an hour with NOTHING but water on our table, a VERY PRETTY and nice woman came to explain the delay, offering MORE SHOTS! 2 cubes of cornbread for 6 people came out, but no appetizer plates. We sliced it and used our hands as plates.\nOur waitress was no where in sight for nearly an hour. 90 minutes in, a server bought out ONE of the six plates and we were told that the catfish and jerk chicken we ordered was no longer available... But, there were 2 tables that sat AFTER us and they were eating catfish and jerk chicken! In fact, one of those tables FINISHED and we still hadn't eaten anything but cornbread! We placed substitute orders and our waitress finally appeared and said \"oh, there's no more catfish or jerk chicken\"...*6 blank faces*\nOver 2 hours in with 4 SHOTS EACH on empty stomacha, more food began to come out. But, the mashed potatoes were swapped for rice (without anyone telling us) and MY FOOD WAS NOT WHAT I ORDERED AT ALL!!! A tall teddy bear of a security guard with a calm soothing voice came to check in... I honestly couldn't get loud or rude if I wanted (which I didn't). 3 hours in this restaurant, my correct order finally came out, WITH MASHED POTATOES! They'd given them to me because I was the last to get food and my order was incorrect. Well, it was not good!\nFull review on Google!"

First disappointment so I literally had to wait for a sit at the bar (40 mins). I didn’t feel like searching for another dinner spot. The food took another  30 mins. Drinks were over priced but the bartender made up by making them on point. I was visiting from Philly so definitely a different vibe as we have more options in Downtown Philly for reasonable prices, better service and food"

We did not have a waiter, but the bartender came and took our order saying he would be helping us with our dinner....this was after waiting approximately 10 minutes bellfore any type of acknowledgement from.anyone.  I asked why were we taking down to this older looking bar area as this is not the type of reservation I made,and we were told they were over booked upstairs so this is where they were seating people for the rest of the evening.   It was not good, ambience was terrible, and music was loud and full of explicit lyrics... highly inappropriate for such a beautiful restaurant with great reviews.  Extremely disappointing.  The food was very good, our waiter(bartender) was nice, but not attentive as he was multitasking between tables and bar patrons.  Will not return.  Showed us a pretty restaurant and got served dinner in a dungeon."

I ordered several items, including fried catfish and shrimp, which were so excessively salty they were inedible. The waffles were bland and tasteless—no amount of syrup could fix them. Then came the bizarrely staggered service, as the food we ordered did not come all at one time: my Lobster Mac & Cheese arrived a full hour after the rest of my food. While the mac & cheese itself was decent, the lobster was an absolute joke—tough, pasty, and a complete waste of money.\n\nThe chicken, though flavorful, came in portions so small it was insulting, and most of the food was served cold. But perhaps one of the most laughable part of the meal was the soggy, lifeless French fries. They were so bad, you’d honestly get better fries at a fast food drive-thru.\n\nWe had to constantly beg the server for water until we finally asked to please fill multiple cups to avoid any further hassle. As if the dining experience wasn’t bad enough, the women’s restroom was appalling—multiple stalls were out of order, many of the faucets were not working, there was almost no soap, and the toilet paper was extremely limited.\n\nFor a restaurant charging such outrageous prices, this was beyond disappointing. Everything from the food to the service was a complete mess and unacceptable. Please do not waste your time or money here."

I ordered the hot honey chicken, it tasted like it had been cooked prior to and dipped back in the oil to re-heat and had the funny taste leftover chicken has. I was disappointed that beer wasn't an option there, only super sweet cocktails and a variety of wines. Overall, i was truly disappointed with the cost compared to the quality of food, as well as 20% gratuity was automatically added for horrible service. I will not be returning."

The fried tomatoes, were okay, I actually liked the grits and sauce that accentuated the tomatoes the most. \n\nI'm a Washington DC native and had to come home at the last minute, I had to switch my reservation from the Charlotte NC location.

This same attendant we called 15 minutes prior to our arrival for 6:30pm couldn’t remember exactly where we’d asked to be seated. She attempted to seat us in the wrong section of the restaurant. Then after realizing her mistake, she took us to our desired reservation seating. This is where the disaster begun. There were gnats and flies everywhere on the lower level of this restaurant. On top of that our waiter was being a complete a hole. Didn’t greet us with a warm welcome. Then after we expressed to him about the issue going on, he responded with the manager is busy right now. As if what we’re sharing with him about their restaurant wasn’t a major safety concern. Then once we spoke with the manager, he only offered to give us a credit for returning to dine of $50. That’s unacceptable and we couldn’t figure out why he couldn’t apply that credit to the bill from yesterday. After all of this my wife and I decided to cancel our food order because we sat for over an hour waiting to be served. Then once we requested the check our food was magically ready to be served. We will not be dining at your restaurant again for a couple of reasons. The two main ones would be cleanliness, and customer service. The restaurant is a fine establishment which we’ve eaten at before. This time it wasn’t a pleasurable experience because of management and staff."

The salmon wasn’t as juicy as I’d imagined it would be, but the jerk chicken was amazing and seasoned to perfection with the spices. The building was very entertaining and energetic at night. I wished they had a small sitting area inside the building and the wait time to be served is quicker. I will going back in the future and hopefully the salmon is better."

It took them almost 30 MINUTES to bring us our drinks!!!! The appetizers came out before the drinks. We watched other tables get second rounds of drinks, and newer guests get their drinks before us. The server barely seemed phased by the fact that we were just sitting there without drinks for 30 minutes.\n\nI would still recommend this place because of their food and ambiance, but I hope they’ll make improvements to their service."

So I thought 😒. We had no waitress for our party of 3. Waited way too long for our drinks. So we didn’t want them anymore. They offered to give them for free but they were made wrong so we still didn’t drink them. I am Allergic to oranges which I said to the “helper” twice while ordering yet my drink came with the oranges inside. The food was over fried so much the flavor was gone. Not worth the prices. Now the one in CLT where I live is epic… I’m just praying that they stay consistent with their great food & service and don’t end up like this one later on down the line."

        "review_text": "This was my second time and my mom and Son first time.  The reason I thought about taking my family to Kitchen and Kocktails was based on my first visit of being pleasantly surprised and impressed with everything.  This time was different.  First, the service was outstanding, and she was very helpful with answering questions regarding food choices.  Music - upon arrival the music was at an acceptable level, meaning you can hear each other without yelling.  However, once the music had to be restarted, the volume was at a Club level and drowned out everyone.  The staff had to be told to turn the volume down.  For a restaurant with such beautiful decor, the music selection and volume are questionable.   Next, I ordered the blackened salmon salad.  I would not recommend this selection.  The picture on the scanned menu is not what you will receive.  My food was presented in a large bowl with what appeared to be a bag of salad and a piece of salmon that can literally fit in the palm of your hand.  I sent it back to the kitchen and requested chicken and waffles. Be advised you are now asked if you want white meat or dark meat which changes the price.  My mom ordered chicken and cinnamon waffles, she rates it a 10/10. My Son ordered the jerk chicken and rates it 5/10 based on the chicken being non-spicy. He also order the mac and cheese and fries which are ala carte and charged separately. He rates the mac and cheese 9/10 and fries 0 due to no season.  Drinks - My mom and I ordered ice tea and it was ok. The taste was more like waterwith liquid sugar. My son ordered the patron frozen margarita and rates it 10/10.  We also ordered salmon bites and I rated it 4/10 due to over seasoned and salty.  The total bill for three people - $274 to include a mandatory 20% Service Fee.  Ambiance - beautiful.  Food - moderate to high depending your taste buds. Cost - $$$$."

Our experience was exceptional from start to finish.\n\nThe atmosphere is vibrant and welcoming, reflecting the rich culture and warmth you'd expect from a top-tier African American establishment. The decor is chic, yet cozy, making it perfect for both casual outings and special occasions.\n\nA special shoutout goes to our server, Daryle W., whose service was impeccable. Daryle’s attentiveness, friendliness, and keen knowledge of the menu made our dining experience truly memorable. He ensured every detail was perfect, from timely refills to personalized recommendations that suited our tastes perfectly.\n\nThe food? Absolutely divine! Every dish burst with flavor and was presented beautifully. Whether it was the succulent fried chicken, perfectly seasoned collard greens, or the decadent mac and cheese, you can taste the love and tradition in every bite.\n\nKitchen + Kocktails is not just a meal, but an experience that nourishes both body and soul. We left with full hearts and even fuller bellies. Highly recommend it for anyone looking to enjoy a taste of African American culinary excellence with top-notch service.\n\nThank you, Kitchen + Kocktails, and thank you, Daryle W., for making this celebration unforgettable. We will be back!"

He returned with a bottle of still water (I assume that this restaurant does not offer a filtered tap or sparkling water like most restaurants in the DMV, since those options were not given) and gave us suggestions on drinks and food. We ordered and enjoyed our meal very much thanks to J being very honest and clear about spice levels, and giving great recommendations.\nThe atmosphere is pretty loud, as the DJ spins popular R&B and Hip Hop hits of the past and present. The mood is one that you will dance and sing along as you enjoy your meal.\nI will definitely return and recommend to others."

Our server had told my friend that only the lunch menu was available, but she came back to the table and told me that the brunch menu was only available. I ordered the cornbread as an appetizer, which was cold and hard. It tasted like it had been cooked days prior and reheated. I ordered the cookies and cream waffles as my entree. The waffles were tasty, but they too were cold. The wait for the food was also a bit long and throughout our time, our server did not come back to check in or ask if we needed anything. When it was time to pay the bill, I almost paid someone else’s bill as well. My overall experience here was very unsatisfactory and not worth the money or the time."

Around 1:20 ish my waitress (who was very nice) told us we were way pass our limit and had to leave.  I wasn’t finished my $37 drink yet and was still sipping. I told her ok and we left. I didn’t realize until after I got in the car I had more than 30 more mins to finish my drink. I felt rushed.

Unfortunately, I wasn't particularly impressed with these dishes and would rate them a 5/10. However, for my entrée, I enjoyed the surf and turf with lamb chops and a fried lobster tail, accompanied by sides of mac and cheese and yams. This entrée was absolutely phenomenal!\n\nThe wait time for food and drinks was impressive, and the cocktails were delightful. However, if you're not a big drinker, I would recommend being cautious with ordering full bottles without assistance.

It also seemed that many of the food items were prepared in advance and perhaps reheated instead of made fresh.  \n\nI'd asked for unsweetened iced tea once I was assured that they had it, but what arrived was sweetened tea that tasted like canned Nestea.  And our server just kind of shrugged and said that he guessed they only had sweetened after all.  The catfish was generally done well but the chef was definitely heavy-handed with the salt.  The greens were the best part of my meal.\n\nMy colleagues salad was apparently long on lettuce and short on salmon."

I informed the hostess my party of 6 are here. She replied, oh I don't think your table is ready, let me go check. The place was pretty empty so my table should've been ready when I checked in 5 mins prior. She walked us to the table and says, your 2 hours start now. She never greeted us, welcomed us, nothing.\n\nWaitress Zee comes to our table with a smile on her face, she welcomed us, and showed us how to access the menu from the QR code. Zee told us all about the menu, what were the popular items, her favorites, the drinks, etc. I was impressed with her knowledge and professionalism. \nWe ordered the K&K omelet, traditional waffles, specialty waffles (they never made it to the table), the mimosa tower, appetizers, and much more.  Every food item was delicious!!! The mimosa tower was perfect for our table and the drinks in the tequila bottles were too cute.\n\nThe bill comes and here are the issues. The menu states a side of traditional waffles are $13, well they charged $17. I pointed this out to Zee and she said, there's nothing she can do because they can't change what the system automatically generates. I call BS, but they weren't willing to make the change. There is a 20% service charge so pay attention to your bill. \n\nHonestly,  I will probably go back because the food was good but slightly over priced.\n\nOh lastly, the women's bathroom only had one working toilet. This place was packed by 12 noon. \nWith these high prices, there is no reason for these toilets not to be working."

This is price gouging at its finest. Add in valet parking which was another $24.00, I spent approx. $100.00 just to dine here. We were seating in a glass room which was dark AF with no lightning.

You’re either going to drink over-priced cocktails, wine, or mocktails. The wine list didn’t match the food options. Champagne option is for show and best offered at a club.\nOverall - I try to support new establishments but I don’t think I’ll head back.

It is disappointing to support a black-owned business only to be treated poorly. The owner only cares about himself and mistreats his managers. He and his associates/ the help are disrespectful, dishonest, and should be approached with caution. Also they force management and staff to leave fake reviews"

The ambiance is nice, I LOVE the photos and simple decor and of course the flower wall. My reservation was on July 4th at noon and this was the first time I've dined here and the music was NOT loud and I appreciated that greatly because usually I cannot hear my friends let alone the waiter. I love that they switch the menu up so you get a great variety, but I still feel like it's slightly overpriced for what you actually receive. All of the sides are a la carte but are small portioned. I ordered the Jerk chicken, which was nicely flavored, and a side of yams but I do not believe it was worth $11 except the fact that my side was bigger than my portion of chicken. My friend ordered shrimp and grits with a side of the shrimp deviled eggs and somehow the order was incorrect but was quickly fixed by our waitress Christy (who was amazing) but I hate sending food back and wasting it being a previous waitress myself. The drinks were really good and although the food took a while to come out despite it being not crowded just yet and most of the table already had food, it was good! Overall it was a decent experience and the food was great! I guess I was hoping overall 3rd time would be a charm but it was good."

There were dirty plates sitting on the table the entire dinner service. I don’t expect to pay nearly $400 for incredibly lackluster service and mediocre food.

Black-owned, great food, drinks on point, good service, great music and all together an entire VIBE. \n\nMy only word of caution to \"know before you go\" is that this restaurant applies a 20% service charge to ALL checks regardless of party size. \n\nOur server was up front about this when presenting the check, advising that the service charge is split among the staff and that if we choose to add additional gratuity, that it would go directly to her. Having worked in the service industry, I did appreciate her candor, however I opted out, as the service charge was $42 and to pay additional on top of taxes and other charges is a bit much. Overall, I enjoyed this place and will likely return again for drinks, happy hour and maybe brunch."

The food is over priced, $37 for two averaged size pork chops and then the average side was $11. The kicker at the end when the check came the server said it’s a 20% service fee and none of that comes to me so you need to leave an additional tip for me.  So we did leave an additional tip only to ask the manager if he was telling the truth and the manager said no that’s a lie and he will be reprimanded and then he gave us the additional tip back. The bathrooms were not clean and all the stalls where there was a sitting toilet were out of order in the men’s restroom."

When we arrived to check in (on time might I add), they instructed us to wait down on the bottom level as our table was not ready and they didn’t want us waiting by the front entrance. We did as told and waited downstairs. 45 minutes passed and we still had not been seated. I went to the hostess to inquire if our table was ready and I was told “we came looking for you but couldn’t find you so we gave your table away.” I found it to be impossible that they came looking for a group of 12 people waiting downstairs. I never got a text notification or open table notification stating my table was ready, and no one came down looking for us. Needless to say, the birthday celebration was tainted by this experience as we had to leave since our table was given away. Yesterday I decided to give the restaurant another try. This time our waitress Sheena was incredible the music was really good as well. I ordered the fried catfish and grits and my friend ordered the fried salmon and grits. Both of our meals were overall salty. To the point we couldn’t enjoy our meal. Because if both of these experiences, I will not be eager to return to this restaurant."

The DJ was great, the drinks were good the pasta was delicious. I did taste the catfish and it was a little salty that wasn’t my dish though. The pasta comes with a crab leg on top and I’m wondering where are we supposed to put the shells because it didn’t come with a small plate to put it on…\nA must try, if you’re looking for a party vibe on the weekend."

It was explained by our waiter  that the music is played loudly to prevent persons from overhearing conversations at nearby tables given that the tables are placed so close to each other.  But this really takes away from the ability to have a relaxing meal and conversation with such wonderful food.  Our ears were ringing when we left because the music was sooo loud.  It is suggested that perhaps the tables can be spaced out better and while that may result in a few less tables on the floor, the customers may be happier.  I have been to the restaurant numerous times with diverse groups of people (young and older) and this is a universal complaint. Thank you for the consideration of possibly lowering the volume."

During  our visit I spoke to a manager about a $50 credit my party was suppose to receive. The manager Ayanna Cook stated the credit would be noted. Our server had no recollection of this ￼ situation. I brought this matter up to my server and the manager came to say the credit would be added, but it to￼ok 30 minutes for the credit to added to pay our bill. After paying our bill we reviewed when we arrived at our hotel. We we’re overcharged . There were two items that we did not ask for and didn’t receive southern catfish and cornbread. At this point I would like a refund for the items that we were charged."

Our server let us know right away that she was new - and, in the few times we saw her after that, she reinforced the point with a near total lack of knowledge or awareness re the menu and how to provide even the most basic elements of service. This ranged from asking two people four times for water to be served (a must given the spicy tilt and high sodium). We were told that wine was not served by the glass (it is) and waited over 1/2 hour for our drinks to arrive - which was about 10 minutes after we received our first apps. Loud is an understatement though the vibe was delightfully celebratory. And all that doesn’t come cheap."

Everything was impeccably prepared, and the service was friendly and attentive (slightly scattered) despite it being close to Mother's Day, and Graduation weekend. I had the chicken noodle soup, which sounds so plain and easy, but was a flavor packed experience here at Kitchen + Kocktails. True to the name of the restaurant, I had a dirty martini, and it was awesomely prepared, with crisp and flavorful olives. The unpleasant surprise came at the very end, when I received the bill at $300 for two. When the server noticed my surprise, she pointed out that a 20% service charge had already been added to our bill of $260.00 (for two people, me having had an appetizer as my dinner). I usually reserve 20% tips for exceptional experiences, but, ok, I thought.  So I said, \"Oh, the tip is already included then.\" \"Well, no,\" she added, \"I have to share that with everyone, if you want ME to get a tip, you'll need to add more.\" The whole interaction seemed to defeat the purpose of giving a tip, and would far exceed what I would consider to be a generous tip, leaving us with a bad experience overall."

I have been eyeing this spot for months, as I've seen rave reviews all of social media about this place. \n\nThis was our first time at this fine establishment and all of our expectations were exceeded. From the beautiful aesthetic, to the tasty food and drinks, to the quality service; literally every single aspect of our time here left us speechless.\n\nI ordered the Frozen Don Julio 70 Magarita and Kajun Kream Pasta. My fiance order the Peach D'usse Frose and Carribean Jerk Lamb Chops with Candied Yams and Mac & Cheese. We also shared an order of the Deviled Eggs with Blackened Shrimp. I am not exaggerating when I say this.... EVERYTHING was a 10/10! We frequent restaurants like Eddie V's and Fogo, so we were left absolutely speechless at the taste and quality of the food and drinks here. Highly recommend!\n\nOur server, Tarik, provided excellent service. He recommended most of what we had and we thoroughly enjoyed everything. Also the manager on duty that night, Moo, came over to check on us. He shared with us that they were actually a bit understaffed, as they don't typically get busy crowds on Monday evenings. We observed Moo assisting the waiters by serving food, making drinks behind the bar, all this on top of his normal managerial duties. We thought that was very telling of his exceptional character, as his efforts truly reflect the core standards of excellence that KK upholds. Great work, Moo and Tarik!\n\nAgain, 10/10! My fiance and I are already planning to make this a monthly tradition. If you are reading this, THIS is your sign to have your next dinner, event, or happy hour at Kitchen + Kocktails!! You will not be disappointed."

See ice was nice, drinks were ok. My entree was horrible. It was cold, and did not have any flavor. I had to send it back twice. The bathroom wasn’t the cleanest, and only one was in working condition!  *Also* The sink is shared with the men’s restroom!!! I feel Ike a notice should be someone alerting guest. Any conversation held can be held between the two bathrooms. It’s a concern ti me because a person could have a conversation about a guy that’s creeping her out and where they’re about to go after, and the other work can hear from the sink(just a thought). Overall, I would give it another try."

Additionally, they add a 20% service charge for all parties, which is fine, but then they request you tip on top of that because as our server stated “the service charge doesn’t go to the server”. Needless to say, I don’t think I’ll be going back."

I noticed the layout changed from when they initially opened last year. The initial layout was better. We were placed in the middle of restaurant and the music was extremely loud, we couldn’t hear ourselves talk.\n\nThe food wasn’t the greatest. From the quality, the taste, the lobster mac was salty, the corn bread was dry, the mashed potatoes didn’t have seasoning and the catfish was stringy. The food was mediocre. The Mocktails were extremely sweet & needed to be diluted with water. The server didn’t check on us, and moved so fast any time we asked for something before asking if we needed anything else. The overall service was consistent with a fast food restaurant once we were seated. I won’t be returning here again. Unfortunately, I do not recommend."

It is also ecstatically cute for pics.\n\nUnfortunately, the service was not good likely due to how busy it was.  Our waitress was really nice, but it troubles me to share that we ordered three appetizers that never made its way to our table.  We also asked for condiments that we did not get until our food was almost finished.  Note, the food was good.  I am happy to share K+K attempted to rectify the situation by taking 10% off each meal.\n\nLastly, I had to return the bill to be corrected, and to make matters worse, we were charged a whopping $42 SERVICE CHARGE (20%)… .   There was even a prompt for a TIP!  Bless there hearts… .☺️\n\nTo the owner(s) of the restaurant, I recommend lessening or eliminating the 20% service charge and make our young folks “EARN” their work through a genuine demonstration of QUALITY service.  Adding a 20% service charge to the bill is unfair to your customers who received subpar service.  It also lessens the pressure for our young folks to always perform at a high standard when they know there is service  money to be shared at the end of the day."

We sit down around 7:20. Food was great however I feel very overpriced. We knew that there was a two hour limit for seating that wasn’t an issue however we didn’t get seated as stated before until 7:20 and they still came around at 8:45 asking us to leave lol. I was so baffled but kindly left. It’s a bit frustrating to give a two hour limit from the reservation time, have us wait, and make us leave early. Other than the time incident we made the most of our experience.  I would recommend I hope that was a one off situation."

So the waitress took it again and apologized. The manager did come out and apologized as well. I received the check and they did take the chicken off and bring a shot for us. (The sides have to be brought separately so that was still on my ticket even though i didn’t get a chance to enjoy them especially not as a meal. I went home hungry and not another entree was offered for food not being cooked properly. Overall , i would give it another try. Like I said the food was seasoned great , service was good, beautiful decorations. My food just wasn’t executed fully. I’m from out of state so hopefully when i come back I can give this place another try. Undercooked jerk chicken TWICE !"

The appetizer trio was the star of the show, with the crab cakes and lamb chops having lots of flavor and specifically the abundance of crab meat used to make the crab cakes. The entrees were disappointing and a let-down after indulging in the promising appetizers, the steak and eggs were bland and uneventful, the hot honey chicken was over fried and hard as a rock. The waffles were not toasted enough which led it to be rather soggy. All in all, I had high expectations with a major let down. I will not be going back."

Our server was all over the place to the point that someone else rang our order in. Numerous friends in the DC area warned me but there’s nothing like experiencing it for oneself. Their only saving grace is the good food. If you’re a foodie and used to great service and exceptional dining experiences this is NOT the place for you. There is no ambiance, it feels like a brunch day party at night. I won’t be returning because their customer service is a 1/5 with 5 star pricing. Not fine dining. Overpriced casual dining with no dress code enforced."

My server was nice but wasn’t too attentive but she could have been in the weeds( overwhelmed) but again she was super friendly. I also put it was my birthday and my server did check my id and seen it was my actual birthday no one offered anything and I wanted dessert but my food took so long I didn’t order anything.

We had a reservation for 5ppl at 12:45 and didn’t get seated until 1:30 after checking in multiple times. We were seated downstairs in the lounge area which is much less lively than upstairs for brunch (we preferred live). But there was a DJ playing slow jams and we asked if he could turn it up a bit and he did so that was nice. \nOur server greeted us and took our drink and appetizer orders. After getting drinks we waited a long time before she came back to take our entree order. When she did come back we still had no appetizers and she told us that we could not order brunch because it was over. Of course we were upset and I went upstairs to speak to the manager and she said she would come down (never did).  I went back to our table and our server spoke to someone to allow us to order brunch. Our appetizers (salmon bites and shrimp deviled eggs) came an hour after we were seated and we were “hangry” at this point. But the appetizers held us over and were both very good! Our server did her best to make up for the long wait and provided the appetizers complimentary, which was greatly appreciated. \n\nNow let’s get into this food!! Once our food came we were happy because baby everything was DELICIOUS!! We had oxtails (outstanding), waffles (plain, butter pecan, and cinnamon) *chef kiss, Mississippi Catfish (grilled) & Grits (excellent), chicken and waffles!\nThe frozen margaritas are good and definitely worth it. The spicy margaritas are good also, if you’re into it! \n\n Our server (Doneisha?) was overworked but she did her thing and helped make up for our overall experience. I believe it was 2 servers downstairs that were taking orders AND making drinks, which is a bit much when trying to maintain great service. Hopefully they get the wait times and food orders together because it almost ruined our experience. However, I will definitely be back because food and atmosphere were on POINT!"

It was so fresh and the shrimp was so big and so delicious. Then I decided to get the shrimp and grits and baby, this was everything, the music was loud but it wasn’t a bad loud. Also have a drink special where you can get the bottle for $30 which I think is really cool. I definitely will recommend this place. Everything was good. ￼"

I don't see the point in the Reservation, but they insisted that they turn walkins away. The food was good, I think I would've enjoyed it better hot. Our forks were taken with our appetizer plates so when the food arrived we waited and had to ask for forks twice, to no avail. Finally I got up and caught someone walking by who gave us forks and syrup to enjoy our food....waffles get cold fast. There was no attentiveness to our table, we didn't have everything we needed when our food arrived. Customer service is the foundation, I understand they were busy, but they have to figure out a good balance."

Frozen fried okra. Leathery chicken fried chicken. Oily gross blackened fish.\n\nThe drinks are so beyond syrupy sweet, it made me feel like a sorority girl on spring break. It’s like they served a glass of grenadine and forgot to put the other ingredients in.\n\nService was AWFUL. They brought the food out about 10 seconds after ordering which tells me it was microwaved. And they chucked it at us. Literally threw onto the table (which we had to ask be cleaned before we sat down). They didn’t even ask who belonged to what food and acknowledged that they didn’t know. “I don’t know who got the Mac and cheese…” tosses on the table in front of the wrong person instead of waiting for us to tell her. As she did with all the food. She put all the food in front of the same person and expected us to pass it out.\n\nNone of us finished our dish or drink.\n\nAlmost a dine and dash moment if I had one ounce less morals.\n\nThe atmosphere was loud and club like. Not a restaurant. They put more effort into their playlist and instagramable fake flower walls than they did food, drink, or service.\n\nI can’t believe 3 of these restaurants exist in the world. I use the term restaurant loosely. It’s a night club with the lights on bright to make sure you get the best pix.\n\nDo not go."

Today, we both got sick from eating our leftovers.  This was our first meal of the day  about noon.  Prior to this, we were fine.  I have visited the one in Dallas, and it didn't upset my stomach and make me sick.  The ambiance and vibe were nice here in DC, but it makes me hesitant to try it again. Being sick after eating leftovers is NOT ok.   I'm going to call the restaurant and let them know."

We ordered off the main menu, devil eggs topped with shrimp, these were delicious, lobster mac and cheese, chicken and waffles and shrimp and grits.  We ordered the Dusse (froze), it was pretty good, however not too strong.  Would probably get something else to drink next time.\n\nOverall an 8.5 out of 10. Only because while waiting to be seated at our table, we went to the bar, and was basically ignored for 20 mins.  \n\nThe place is nice, smooth music playing in the background via a DJ, our server was pleasant.  Will probably come back and try brunch."

Initially, they did not have enough chairs for our party of 7.  When the appetizers came there were no plates and missing silverware. The server said the restaurant did not have enough plates, so we'd have to share plates. When we choose to share sides and did not order individual sides for each person, the server seemed irritated and borderline rude.  (Some of the sides came out 20 minutes before the entrees.)  The irony is even though service was bad (the server never checked on us), she told us if we tipped, she'd get the entire tip. I still do not know if the check amount was correct because she said she could not provide us with the itemized bill. All she did was show us the total on the handheld device. My brother and I split the bill. He felt obligated to tip 20%. I chose to tip 10% even though my cousin said to leave $0. Later, I was told by a friend that the service charge should have included the tip. On the bright side, the food was great. Too bad I won't be returning when I go back to DC."

Asked her to repeat what she was saying several times. Asked her for hot water. Finally received it after about the 5th or 6th ask. Forgot to bring out my husband’s appetizer and said she couldn’t guarantee if it would come out before the food. My husband told her he wanted it before the food so she said she would rush the kitchen. However, the rest of our appetizers were already out. Waited for our food for an extended time. There was a mix up with the food. Finally corrected that. Food was average but very overpriced. A glass of spring water is $11. Parking is not convenient. Valet is $25. Spent $320 for brunch for 3 no alcoholic drinks. They included a service fee of $50 to be split by the waitress and the people who brought out the food. This does not include any tip you give to the server."

He was pleasant, asked about any dietary restrictions and even created a new dish not on menu because I am a vegetarian. He was attentive and the explanation of the bill was A1. He deserves all the kudos. He made the experience enjoyable. Our food was hot and literally we blinked and it was at the table. No wait for our drinks or food. Did I mean the cocktails, chefs kiss! All and all, 10/10 recommend. O, even security at the door was pleasant and they greet you with a \"welcome home\". We will be back for sure!\n\nCons: The seating process can be tweaked. Although you have a reservation there is no true area to stand and they just kind of yell out your name. No true order.\n\nAlso, I picked this place because from the dress code I totally it assumed it would have a certain vibe. I even made my boyfriend go home and change because he had on a hat and tennis shoe. But when we arrived, the women were half naked, guys with hats on and tennis shoes. Do you not enforce the dress code?\n\nAll that aside, Jay completely changed our experience. We're thinking about going back for brunch tomorrow! I am visiting from Houston so I can't wait to try the Dallas location!"

The bartender was pretty un attentive for the most part aside from a conversation she was having with another gentleman at the bar. After being sat our server, I hate that I forgot his name because he was the best part of the experience. I ordered his recommendations and the fried chicken was undercooked, the lamb was overcooked, and the mac and cheese needs seasoning. That's not the servers fault. He was honest and attentive. He even went the extra mile to return my earbud to me that I left at the table in my rush to leave. I can't say that I would come back or recommend this restaurant but would encourage you to try it for yourself as there are mixed reviews. I still support black owned 🤎🖤"

The rose flower walls were cute for pics. On the way out to our car, we peeked at the lower level, which seem fun with the DJ and lounge setting. Valet was good.

However my drink nor water was ever refilled or asked to be refilled. No one asked how the food was ok if we needed anything. I had to ask 4 different employees to find my waiter. No one knew who “Raven” was. Once I asked for my boxes and receipt it took an additional 23 minutes for this to be provided. Once again had to hunt down my waitress. Just not pleased - considering the 20% tip included I shouldn’t have to go look for my waitress twice to find her cackling in a corner with other employees. As an event planner this place has AMAZING potential. Employees could use some customer service training and chefs to slow down and focus on their craft. Thank you"

I figured out why at the end. His 20% ($40) was already locked in! No need for pleasantries or respectable customer service.. he automatically earned his tip without doing absolutely nothing! He didn’t take my order, bring out my drinks, nor my food. Better off sitting at the bar in my honest opinion.

The collard greens are def a 8.5 out of 10 it’s a must have side. I tried the mac and cheese and yams and wasn’t really too impressed with either. I would say the mac and cheese is 7/10 and the sweet potatoes 6/10, but that’s just me. I don’t think the sweet potatoes were sweet enough. The chicken was a little\nToo salty for me, but it’s something i will order again from there. I had the non alcoholic rum fruit drink which was super good it’s worth a try just sip a little slow because those don’t have free refills lol.  Great experience overall and I plan to return to try other things on the menu and see what the lounge is that they have downstairs."

She had the best personality and was very attentive.\nOur food came out timely, was fresh and delicious as always. I actually said out loud, this one might be better than Dallas!\nMy only complaint was the music was a little too loud. I had to holler to talk to my family next to me.\nOne lady got up to “twerk” at the music and IMMEDIATELY was told tastefully by male (I’ll assume security); to have a seat!

They have good food and creative drinks but everything else is downhill. At this price point and location one would expect a somewhat upscale, well-serviced experience. Pros: my meal was good, one staff member offered complimentary bottled water and a shot for inconveniences he was aware of. Cons: I was not acknowledged by a wait staff member until 35+ minutes after being seated (not even offered water), the waitress was clearly overworked and had an attitude, the bathroom was filthy and didn’t have any hand soap, there is a mandatory 20% gratuity charge and the service was nowhere near justifying that amount, the party next to me waited an hour for their food which was brought out cold; this very polite and friendly coupled was pushed to the point of demanding a full refund and leaving hungry. I should have left also but stayed because every restaurant we looked up in the vicinity was closed and we were already there. I think this could work well as a Carryout with a large waiting area in another location."

The music and crowd were not too loud and people were dressed decent casual to slightly dressy. I parked on the street in front of the restaurant, which appeared to be mostly two hour parking and valet. Service was really nice/helpful but really slow. It took about 40 minutes after ordering to get our entrées. The people next to us sat 15 to 20 minutes before being greeted. My friends and I had salmon bites, chicken and waffles, and the catfish breakfast. Food was ok, not great. I’ve had much better brunch food at basic less expensive restaurants. It felt like our entrees were missing a sauce or topping or something that would have elevated the dishes. The drinks were definitely the highlight. We had the frozen margaritas and peach D’usse.. I’d give both an 8/10. Decor/ambiance was cute but gave that eerie nightclub during the day vibe due to the black walls and recessed lighting. I read in another review that this location used to be Toro Toro.. yes it definitely is the same place. We spent $100 each with gratuity. Overall I’d recommend K+K for drinks, and I’m guessing dinner is more impressive than brunch."

The food was only slightly warm, pickles were way too salty and the grits had zero flavor. They did have a limited selection of wines but nothing by the glass and the bottles were extremely overpriced (having worked in the wine business). Average was $200-$400 for wines you can buy in the store for under $20. I will try the Dallas location next time. May just be the DC location that was lacking.

He played a nice blend of music from various regions, genres, and time periods. \n\nThe food however was lacking. My friend and I ordered the oxtails and were both underwhelmed. Neither of us finished our meal. Our crab fries were on the salty side; and the salmon bites were dry. My bf and his brother enjoyed their meals; fried chicken with pigeon peas and rice and chicken and waffles respectively. \n\nI would return for the drinks and atmosphere."

Host staff seemed overwhelmed but still maintained a level of courteousness.\nWhat I did not like, when your table was ready they yelled out your name like you're at a buffet waiting to be seated.\nUnfortunately no one even yelled out my name we had to ask the hostesses for a second time if our table was ready and that's when she lead of to our seats.\nThere was definitely a sticker shock when I saw the menu and drink price. I have no issue paying $$$ for a meal and ambience. When I'm paying that price I'm expecting the ambience and food quality to match. Sadly neither do.\nThis restaurants food cost are low. Based on the menu offering there's nothing high end about the ingredients. What we ordered: $422\nSides: Collard green, (2) candied yams, (2)Mac and cheese, and corn bread.\nEntree: (2) fried chicken, fried catfish, salmon, Appetizers: deviled eggs with shrimp, cat fish bites, and fried pickles.\n1 bottle of La crema chardonnay: retails at your local market for $13 we paid $52!!! I definitely understand alcohol cost but please La crema??? If you're going to upcharge be a bit more creative in your wine selection.\nThere was no shortage of Tequila, cognac and Rum cocktails for $21+ and of course Ace and Monet champagne. However this is a finer dinner experience (at least the price point would suggest it is) please offer a better wine selection.\nI was so confused, there's a fire dancer at night. She barely has a space to perform and the ceiling are too low! One of the food runners became nervous when she walked passed him. He mentioned to us he could feel the heat from her fire sticks!\nLastly WHY MUST WE KEEP OUR USED     SILVERWARE?!!! If you're clearing the guest table give them fresh utensils. I'm paying for an experience and if I want to use the same utensil I'll eat at home!\nK&K you have your work cut out but hey maybe you will improve."

It’s virtually impossible to find an alternative nice dinner for 4 people at 6 pm on Christmas.  The other places that were open were booked.  This reservation system (which also had me confirm my reservation) failed me big time and it’s hard to believe the restaurant was completely unaware.  Others were standing outside in the same boat.  I’ll go back because the menu sounds great, but I’m not from DC so it will be on a future visit.  Lesson learned though, don’t trust this process.  CALL restaurants to confirm well in advance."

When the appetizers arrived, the bartender mentioned she would \"take care\" of the charges for the appetizers but when we received the bill, she charged us for half the price. Nice gesture but if we say you were going to do something, you should. We didn't mind the charge, just surprised."

We didn’t receive entrees until (4:25pm) at that point everyone had reordered drinks twice. Overall this is a nice spot with friendly staff and good food and drinks.

We ask the bus lady who was cleaning the table next to us for water and she brought the manager over. By this time we have be at the restaurant for over an hour starving. The manager was really nice and apologized, he was able to bring us water finally. Our waitress was so amazing but I think she had too many tables. We finally get our drinks and place our order. Our food comes out really late, like after 11 pm. By the time we leave it is past midnight and had spent the evening in this restaurant."

Atmosphere was very loud and difficult to hear each other’s conversations.   Service was extremely slow and we had to ask for our bottle of wine 3x before it arrived.  Something to be aware of is that they add a 20% gratuity to all orders… we asked if gratuity was included and they told us it was not so we added 20% additional only to find out that it was already built in. At that point we were running late (we were there 2 1/2 hours… again very slow service) and had no time to argue this expense.  When questioned we were told the first 20% went to all staff the 20 we left went directly to him!  Why wouldn’t you have explained that in the first place?!  That left us feeling a bit burnt!\nIn summary we would definitely return for the food, allow more time (if that’s possible) & enter with the understanding that gratuity is included."

The restaurant itself is beautiful but where we was sat the lights where out and it was dark. We literally had to use our flashlight to see our food. I wanted to or the jalapeño margarita but with pineapple instead of strawberry, they couldn’t make the changes cause their cocktail was premix. We got deviled eggs (seem premade shrimp was cold and nasty) the fried pickles were extremely salty. Then the batter on the chicken and lobster is beyond salty. Not seasoned but SALTY. This place is great for an Instagram aesthetic and taking photos. Not for food. It’s unfortunate this experience was bad cause I was really looking forward to dining here but the experience was upsetting by all means. I will say our server MAYA was extremely nice and gave good service"

Since there were only a few other people there, we had a chance to speak with the executive chef and he recommended some options from the menu. He also gave us an extra appetizer (the shrimp deviled eggs) which were very good. We had the shrimp and grits,a side of greens and chciken & butter pecan waffles. Those were the best waffles I have ever had, I’m not exaggerating. The chef also brought out another flavor of waffles from the menu for me to try, and they were also delicious. Drinks were pretty and tasted good, but on the expensive side. Pricing is a bit high. On my check there was the chicken & waffles, 1 margarita and a bottled water. The total was $80. Neither of us were offered receipts or had a chance to see the charges so I’m not sure of the price breakdown. Overall, the interior is very nice, staff was personable and engaging and the food was great."

We had the salmon bites, jerk lamp chops, shrimp and grits, hot honey chicken, chicken and waffles, blackberry margarita, rum punch and the frozen Don Julio. We didn’t try any desserts and we deeply regret it. Everything was a-ma-zing! Thank you guys for such an amazing experience. This was my first time in DC and thanks to K+K, it jumped off pretty well. Will be coming back again and I HIGHLY recommend 10/10"

I tried two drinks both were pretty good which was a plus, the food was flavorful which kind of saved the night. And, lastly although this may be minor to some but was kind of annoying to me. The chairs aren't the proper height for the tables we were sitting at. \n\n My son loved the place. For me the level of service in no way aligned with the price."

It is rather loud in here the music is great but it’s hard to hear each other. My server was very polite to start. There was an unfortunate accident of my order being knocked off the screen which resulted in waiting over an hour for my food. Stuff happens I do practice some patience. The manager offered free refills of our lemonades and complimentary desserts. My food was ok. The fish is great however those unseasoned greens and fast food mac n cheese did not impress me for the price and the food was almost cold. In the end my server just kind of disappeared. Not really sure if she thought I was upset at the wait but I wasn’t going to take it out on her. At this point I am on hour 3 sitting here and I am ready to go. Asking for to go boxes and check was a chore. Then our complimentary dessert turned into one order and not one for each of us. I was not offered a receipt so I can’t even tell if I was charged accurately. I have a feeling the refills of the lemonade did not end up being complimentary. She took that hand held card reader so fast after my payment and ran off. I feel like I was scammed on the bill and the error of losing the order should have been handled by taking a percentage off my bill. This was definitely a one and done for me."

Now I tell u this , DO not order water, they charged me $22 for 2 waters, I repeat DO NOT order water. Now the menu items we had were good (surf and turf) the jerk lamb chops were just over cooked and I don’t think they were good lamb chops to begin with, but the fried lobster was very good and the lobster Mac and cheese. The blackberry margarita is something you should definitely get if you like sweet drinks, I usually don’t prefer this but I can’t lie it was very good. Now keep in mind I got the surf and turf, 2 drinks, the lobster Mac and 2 waters and my bill was 206$ with a $33 service charge and the girl said the gratuity service charge wasn’t even the tip so on top of that you have to leave a tip, all I can say is yeah it was cool but kitchen kocktails will never see me again and all I can tell people about it is I got robbed, 22 for waters and 150 for some mid food,"

We got our app 15 minutes later. Still no drinks. 20 minutes later, STILL no drinks and no main course order was taken. So, I asked for the check and was charged $50 for a cold app and terrible service. I will never go back!"

I saw the prices for some of the other things and I think it was overpriced, but regular brunch items is reasonable. My food was delicious.

Attempting to avoid the server having to come back and forth multiple times. “Kocktails”,Appetizers, Entrees ordered at once. Drinks and appetizers arrived at 11 food followed about 20-25mins after. We were just so unpleased about the cold overfilled standing/waiting area, the random guy bringing frozen daiquiri shots around to comfort our hour plus waiting time, shoulder to shoulder standing to be seated, watching other people servers take so long to return with drinks that they ordered when we checked in w/ the hostess at 9:12 just getting to the table as we were finally getting seated was mind boggling.

The catfish was perfectly seasoned and fried to perfection, while the creamy stone-ground grits provided a comforting backdrop to this delightful creation. It was a harmonious combination of flavors that left us wanting more.\n\nNext up, we tried the pecan waffles and chicken - a true masterpiece on a plate. The waffles were light and fluffy, adorned with roasted pecans that added an irresistible crunch. Paired with tender fried chicken, it created a symphony of sweet and savory notes that danced on our taste buds.\n\nThe appetizers at Kitchen + Kocktails are not to be missed either. The fried pickles were addictive - crispy on the outside yet tangy on the inside, they were simply irresistible. And oh my, let's talk about their fried green tomatoes! Each bite revealed a burst of tanginess complemented by the perfect amount of crispness. It truly showcased traditional cooking at its finest.\n\nOne dish that stood out among all was their shrimp deviled eggs - an innovative twist on classic favorites. The creamy deviled eggs blended seamlessly with succulent shrimp, creating an explosion of flavors in every bite. It was unique, deliciously satisfying, and left us wondering how such simple ingredients could create something so extraordinary.\n\nOf course, no meal is complete without exceptional drinks – and Kitchen + Kocktails did not disappoint in this department either. Their cocktails were expertly crafted by skilled mixologists who clearly took pride in their craft.\n\nFive star service, I will go again."

The only draw back was we had a reservation for 8:15pm and did not get seated until 8:50pm, but the manager did come out and apologize to all those that were waiting and tried to speed up the process of seating everyone. This was a great place i would definitely recommend it."

The meals are a bit pricey and they did not disclose the price of the tower before purchasing so the the price was a shock when the bill arrived. That would be my only complaint. I didn't ask the price of the tower because I mistakenly assumed it would be about the price it other towers at other brunch locations, I was wrong. I can't wait to try this again with more friends. The managers circulated to check on tables as well as our waitress. Not once did we feel unattended. When our time limit expired they politely suggest us moving to the lounge downstairs. The only issue with that is that we attempted to go to the lounge but it wasn't open. They shouldn't suggest the lounge if it isn't open, just tell us our time is up and we need to leave."

And when I had large sums of cash, I would take it encountered elsewhere at the register and then bring it back change if needed.\n\nBut other than that, wonderful experience will come back again. Next time, I'll just pay with card."

The waitress and manager tried to be empathetic and provide support by comping the meal and charging for the drinks we had, but the damage of having a screw in my meal caused me to lose interest in the food or restaurant experience. Supportive waitress though"

The bill was $250 for two people with a $40 tip because they automatically add 20% gratuity for horrible service. Decor is nice and ambience is real cute though. Also food is bland for the aesthetic taste to be southern/cajun cuisine. I will not go back."

We were seated in a quiet area, so we thought (the longer you sat, the louder it got) - mostly because the music is so loud you have to talk louder to hear one another.\n\nOur waiter was nice and helpful but after she took our appetizer order she took forever to come back and place our actual order but she was nice about it and over all good. Then it took even longer for the food to come out, if it wasn’t for the manager coming to check on us, it may had been longer, thank you for assisting😊.\n\nNow for the food - definitely can say it was saltyyyy, anything that has batter just know it’s probably too salty-GOOD-but salty. Appetizer proportion size for the price is to small but GOOD. Entree size portion good but overpriced - I think maybe we were expecting a wow factor when the price is in a certain range. We did not try any drinks but the drink menu look interesting and yes they’re pricey too - let’s just say IF I return that Frozen $$$ drink betta be something for me to say “ONE MORE PLEASE”.\n\nOverall nice place - food good but battered items to salty - if your a naturally loud person this is the place for you, seriously it’s very loud."

One of the items came out cold, it was sent back and still came out cold.\n\nMy biggest concern & main reason for writing this review is because of the cost of our bill. ￼ We were overcharged for everything that we ordered. For example the cost of the fish and grits on the menu stated $25 we were charged 33 each. The cost of two scrambled eggs on the menu stated nine dollars we were charged $13. ￼ We were also charged for an items that we sent back because be changed our mind prior to the item coming out!

Arrived about 10 mins before my 5pm reservation and was informed they were behind the wait would be 45 MINUTES! At this point, left with no other options we opted to wait and went downstairs in hopes of getting a drink while waiting. We waived over about 2/3 bartenders asking for service. We were served water and told they’d be back yet no return. By the time we actually put in a drink over 45 mins had gone by and our table was no ready. We were assured they would have it brought to us upstairs. We are now seated and about 20 mins go by and no one even acknowledges us or offers water. I had to flag someone down (Darryl) who began to assist us. He was fantastic by the way. We waited for our drinks thinking the previous staff actually put them in by now its been an hour and fifteen mins with no drink. I let Darryl know and he immediately gets it taken care of. The food was over salted and mediocre at best. The jerk chicken was like a dry rub rotisserie chicken. No jerk flavor whatsoever. The mac and cheese was inedible. I literally didnt finish my food. For the price of everything it was not worth it and the service was deplorable. They are definitely selling a “vibe” more than actually quality food. If you want a good drink that may take an hour to arrive this is the place for you. But if you are hoping for great food to accompany it, think again. Definitely will not be returning."

        "review_text": "This is my second time going to Kitchen and Kocktails, but my first time during a VERY busy brunch weekend. It was Howard Homecoming and I’m not sure how or why, but it was overwhelming on entrance. I had a reservation but that didn’t exclude us from the chaos that was this weekend. Upon entering, you had to stand in a line to check-in, but you soon found out it was just people standing around. The group in front of my said they had been waiting since 1:30 pm and it was now 2:20 pm and they hadn’t checked in.\n\nDespite that, my party of 2 was seated at around 2:55 on for a 2:15 reservation, which given the circumstances, was great, but not ideal. Once seated, our waitress attended to us pretty quickly and kept in touch. Our appetizers were the dream eggs topped with blackened shrimp, a favorite of mine, in addition to the salmon bites. The bites were over cooked, salty and the temperature was not warm so those weren’t my favorite. We didn’t place our order for our entrees until about 20 minutes after we finished our appetizers. It took about 45 minutes to an hour for our meals to come out, and our waitress let us know the kitchen was behind. We both ordered chicken and waffles. My niece ordered the specialty waffles which were smothered in peaches. She ate the peaches, however the waffles were extremely soggy to the point she didn’t really eat them. The chicken was tasty. We ordered white meat and were given a breast and a leg. The skin is good but if you want more meat than skin then you probably shouldn’t order the white meat. I had a frozen Patron blackberry margarita which was good. Probably not worth $37 but I still enjoyed it.\n\nOverall an okay experience given the struggles with getting people seated and the service."

Definitely should make reservations. They take much pride in their food and make sure customers are satisfied. If the food wasn’t to your liking they have no problem taking it back and redoing it. The managers walk around and greet customers. Overall me and my husband had a great experience. Would recommend."

Perfect balance of checking on us and leaving us to enjoy our food and drinks. Both Nini and Dominique worked together to make recommendations because it was difficult to choose from the menu items-they all sounded so appetizing.\n\nWe got the Cotton Candy Cloud drink (fun presentation!), then the delicious Dream (deviled) Eggs with blackened shrimp. It was Sunday afternoon brunch time, and we got Chicken (seasoned as well as my own mother’s perfect recipe) and Cinnamon Roll (perfect crust of sweetness) Waffles and Shrimp and Grits for our entrees. Ahhh-MAAAA-zing. I asked to meet the chef so that I could compliment him personally, and Nini was kind enough to make that happen. She then recommended the peach cobbler for dessert. Legendary. Whew! What culinary masterpieces, with each dish meticulously prepared and plated. I decided to order the short ribs with roasted brussels sprouts and carrots, with gravy and mashed potatoes to go. So glad I did…\n\nOverall, what truly sets this restaurant apart is its friendly and attentive staff working to provide an atmosphere that is high-end without being exclusive, and friendly without being phony. The service was impeccable, with every member of the team going above and beyond. Other patrons were singing along with the music playing, taking photos & videos, laughing, and having a great time. It’s definitely a place to go for a special occasion, connect with friends, or just go because you deserve a treat."

The drinks (strawberry jalapeño marg and blackberry marg) were both too sweet for me, but they definitely were IG-worthy as far as presentation).  The southern fried chicken was just okay (nothing unique or bold about it, probably better with sauce on it)…didn’t eat most of it, the mac and cheese was also just okay (again, nothing particularly unique or bold)…I did eat it all though, and the greens were good (although more stalk than I would like).  Soul/southern food is tastes are so subjective and we usually were introduced to it through home cooking (granny, big mama). So, I’m usually not raving over restaurant soul food.  The service was great throughout, and the music was very good. I’d go back here if I were taking someone who was visiting from out of town.  It’s a great vibe and location."

The prices are exuberant for the quality and amount of food served. Seems like the restaurant is more for “the vibes”. The vibes being, loud music (nice r&b selections), pretty rose wall, and not that uniquely made, overpriced, cocktail drinks. I loved the intimate area with the marble printed walls and also the seats. But it’s just not enough to justify the prices. I mean, $22 for two small sized chicken thighs (it was $19 but they charged an additional $3 for two thighs instead of a leg and thigh lol). I just can’t get jiggy with that even though we “got it”. We did hear that they’re thinking about placing a location in Charlotte, NC (where we’re from) but NC ain’t DC. The prices unfortunately would not make it down there. But good luck!\n\nFor those thinking of booking, the jerk lamb chops are 5 stars. The flavor, spice level, and char on those things were A1. The mac n cheese + yams were decent sides but again, the prices are insane."

It was so loud we had to literally yell at each other to have a conversation. It gives club vibes, which is fine for younger patrons but no much for people our age.  The food was AMAZING!  I had the pork chops with a side of Mac and cheese and they both were delicious, but you have to order your sides separately. They do have a number dishes on the specialty menu that include a side, so you’re not completely left having to order your meal a la carte. The only minor complaint I have is that they add a 20% service charge to your bill, which isn’t that odd, but that is usually the tip. When we asked the server about it, he really couldn’t give us a clear answer on what this service charge was for. Aside from that, i would highly recommend trying Kitchen + Kocktails."

Because it was our first time there, not sure if they blast music during dinner or lunch service.

The hostess greeted us warmly and we were seated. My waitress was great. Now, let's get to the food. We started with the fried green tomatoes and the devil eggs, which were great. It was very tasty. I ordered the lobster and waffles, and my cousin ordered the pork chop breakfast. My dish was definitely overpriced. I was expecting a larger lobster tail for the price of $50! The tail was very small and quite disappointing. My cousin's fried porkchop tasted rancid, and the breading left much to be desired. A glass of lemonade was $9!! I wanted a glass of wine with my meal, but they don't sell wine by the glass. You have to buy a bottle, which I wasn't doing since I was the only one drinking. Overall, I was quite disappointed in the overpriced food."

We sat at the bar while waiting on our table and even getting a simple drink took quite a while. Seating was a bit awkward for date night. The large round table created too much space between us plus the music (though it was 🔥) was so loud we couldn’t really hear each other. He said his appetizer had too many shells in it (seafood gumbo). Mine (salmon bites) was AMAZING but I didn’t get out until after I already had my entree. The food made up for the less than stellar service. We had lamb chops, fried lobster tail, greens, mac and cheese, yams, corn bread, and a frozen peach dusse drink (we had to split it but it so soooo good). I wish we had time for dessert. It was a young crowd but overall I think I’d come again (just not on an empty stomach or for any romantic occasion)."

The vibe is really nice but the music is extremely loud. The entire restaurant was yelling over the music to their waiters and dinner companions. We were also disappointed to learn that there is no regard to our reservation indicating we were celebrating our wedding anniversary. When we booked our table we were “gifted” $25 via email if we downloaded and used the in kind app. I took time to set it up and add my credit card. However, the DC location didn’t honor the credit. This spot has the potential to be a beacon of black excellence in the city but it has an element of greedy/stingy ownership."

All in all I was extremely happy with everything. The drinks were a lil pricey being that I am from the south but they were great drinks So i had no issues.   Paid 11 or 12 for bottle water just because we didn't know there was free water but overall a great experience. Ra ked up a 400 bill but I didn't complain. Just wishing got free water.

Then, when it came, it appeared as if it had been thrown together quickly. When I received the check, the drink reflected on the bill was much higher than the one I ordered and received. The waiter fixed that though. I was just expecting to love it, but only liked it. Not sure if I’ll return."

We were seated 30mins after our reservation. We could barely hold a conversation between the 2 of us due to the noise level. And for some reason we were asked to “scoot” our table several times (which I thought we might be accommodated for in some way being the only table that had to move constantly). 2 shots of Henny cost $50. The more I write the more I think I should take another star away… It was a good night overall, but certain things obviously stood out.\n\nOct 3. Update. p.s. they don’t actually value feedback. They responded saying how positive this review was, not responding to any of the many criticisms I listed out."

        "review_text": "My recent dining experience at this restaurant was a bit of a mixed bag. The evening started with a warm welcome from the hostesses, who kindly offered us the option to explore the lounge or the bar while we waited for our table. However, I was taken aback when I tried to order a simple ginger ale at the bar and was informed of a two-cocktail minimum. It felt a bit off-putting, especially since I was there for dinner and not necessarily looking for alcoholic drinks. Although there were non-alcoholic options on the menu, the bartender didn't suggest any to me.\n\nOnce we were seated, our server made a positive impression. She was incredibly energetic and personable, offering recommendations for frozen drinks and appetizers. I appreciated the creative presentation of the frozen drinks in repurposed bottles. However, not all was perfect with the food. While the appetizer trio was a good suggestion, the angel eggs lacked flavor, and the shrimp was slightly overcooked. We also sought her opinion on the short ribs entree we ultimately chose, but unfortunately, it was a bit disappointing. The short rib had too much fat, and the whipped potatoes tasted like something out of a box. The saving grace was the flavorful gravy, but both the meat and potatoes should have had more flavor on their own.\n\nThere are a few other things to be aware of when dining here. Firstly, they charge for your choice of still or sparkling water without explicitly mentioning it. My dining companion was not pleased with this lack of communication. Additionally, they inform you at the time of payment that the service fee is split among the staff, but any additional gratuity goes directly to the server. The music in the restaurant was loud but tasteful. Unfortunately, I had an upset stomach the next day.\n\nIn conclusion, I might consider returning to this restaurant with different expectations. The appetizers and drinks are enjoyable, and I would assume the sides are as well. Bon appétit!"

Coming in it’s a very loud establishment not an intimate setting at all. Nonetheless, we were greeted by a lively lady the wait for our table didn’t take long at all. We were seated and our waiter(Chris) greeted us and gave us a run down on his preferences of the food and drinks. We ordered the salmon bites which were the best part of the night then we got the catfish and grits, the Asian Hennessy catfish with collard greens and Mac and finally the southern fried chicken with yams and Mac. The Mac was not our favorite very watery. The yams were great and the catfish was ok being from Louisiana my expectations were high. The chicken was over done. Our drinks however were great we had the mango and strawberry Don Julio bottles. Our waiter (Chris) made a mistake while talking to us and after we corrected him the enthusiasm immediately left him. Which caused his service to dwindle which was so unfortunate. After three drinks and three entrees our bill was $350.00. Which was outrageous! Try your luck but we won’t be back."

The ambiance was very nice. The food was actually good. I had the lamb chops and my friend had the salmon. We shared the sides, greens and mashed potatoes which was very pleasantly good. The greens were made with turkey which I can appreciate because I try to stay away from pork. The service was good. Although they closed at 10, they did not rush us out. Overall, it was a very good experience. I will be returning."

He went so far as to ask us if we wanted to try a sample for free to which we said yes. However, instead of a smoke arriving, he brought these grand drinks to us and told us to drink them and nearly refused to take them back. We were taken aback like no we only agreed to a sample no thank you! After that things were good from a service perspective. The food was decent although it was overpriced and the majority of the items were served ala carte. Otherwise, it was good overall and I recommend giving it a try at least once!"

We were told that we could go downstairs to the lounge and order food and drinks while we waited on our table. However, any food or drinks that were bought downstairs at the lounge were not allowed to be brought upstairs when our table was ready. So we were literally chugging $25 drinks in order to get to our table before the hostess gave it away. The staff overall was pretty good. The lounge bartenders were sweet. The hostess was friendly and our server was great. A lot of stuff was just out of their control it seemed. However, the manager was a bit off. My husband’s chicken was pink and red on the inside (literally on the bone) and she tried to tell us it was because of the seasoning the chefs use before taking it back to the kitchen. So this automatically told me that this was a regular issue because what type of excuse is that? Then after she took it to kitchen she came back and said the bone marrow they use to cook it makes it that color. I’ve literally never heard of anyone using bone marrow to make fried chicken. The lamb chops tasted spoiled. The drinks were pretty good. Overall, I’m super disappointed in this experience. It seems as though there’s too much focus on the ambience and not enough on the actual food."

It was ok didn’t have fresh blackberries.\n\nDinner we ordered southern catfish, southern fried chicken, greens, sweet potatoes  and cornbread. Everything was a la carte. Typically a la carte sides are shareable these were basic individual sides at $9 for cornbread -$11 each. The greens were so salty I couldn’t eat them. Everything else was just ok. The food was luke warm. Kicker they add 20% service charge to EVERY check it was explained that was NOT the tip. So if you wanted to leave a 20% tip you were in fact tipping 40%. THIS IS EXPLAINED AT THE END OF YOUR MEAL. It should be on your website and prominently on your menus etc.\n\nWe live in DMV we know it’s expensive to eat in DC,  but $116 for a simple meal one cocktail no soda or dessert and VERY small portions is RIDICULOUS.\n\nThis isn’t about the cost.  Rather what you get for the cost. Tupelo Honey is a better choice."

There were several birthdays being celebrated and everyone in the house cheered for them.  That was very warming.  \nThe Food:  The food was tasty.  It gives soulfood vibes.  You will be paying $$$$.  Average entrée price is $30.  The specialty drinks are really cute.  I had the Peach Dussee bottle.  I know you don't know me, but it was enough to get me right and I've drunken grown men under the table my entire drinking career.  It was also very tasty.  I would suggest this as an excellent birthday or special occasion spot.  Almost every customer was dressed to impress and I came in there with business casual Jesus sandal attire... but you know what, it was still cute and welcoming.  An Experience!  Just so you are aware...minimum $100 per person and gratuity will be included. 💫"

The first round of drinks was amazing 2 blackberry margaritas the presentation was beautiful with the blackberries and the flower on top. 1 - 21 questions and the Don iced drink in the bottle “can’t remember the name” The food was not worth it the vegan bowl- the rice was severely over cooked “literally fat very much giving parboiled rice” the greens was way too sweet, I took 4 bites. The southern fried chicken was overly salty “ I’ll just sum it up to maybe that’s the southern style taste idk. The only win with the food was the salmon Cesar salad and the shrimp with the egg. We ordered a second round of the blackberry margaritas because the first one tasted amazing and ohh what a disappointment. Not only did they come without the blackberries and the flower the taste was not the same. I asked the waitress where was the blackberries she said they ran out. At that point we were over it. The bill $345 was NOT at all worth it. I was super excited to visit this place due to the social media hype honestly but unfortunately not what I expected."

FOOD: I was disappointed that entrees came before apps; that’s when I knew we were being rushed gingerly. I didn’t expect the salmon bites/ fried shrimp/ catfish to have the same breading; they were tasty, just the same flavor. My blackened salmon was undercooked. I didn’t eat it at the restaurant (everything came together, so I chose to eat the deviled eggs and salmon bites my partner ordered); the sides, yams, and Mac and cheese were flavorful and good portions. Overall, I’d come back for a drink at the bar. Oh, and the drinks were cute. We did check out the lounge Kanvas, but I won’t review them; it was opening night."

Can't really have a conversation period due to the noise level. In addition, the nickel and diming is ridiculous. You can't even get tap water, you have to pay $11 for room temperature Acqua Panna that could've very well been tap water because the bottle wasn't opened in front of us and they didn't offer any ice for that warm water. The constant pushing for liquor consumption is also quite annoying. I don't mind paying for drinks but, I am NOT paying $37 for a 20 ounce slurpee with an ounce of liquor. The interior of the restaurant is rather nice. However, there was only 1 toilet working in the women's restroom and there are 4 stalls. My friend wants to come back one more time to see if it was just an off day but, I don't care to go back. I understand that DC has high rent but, I couldn't help but feel like the experience was price gouging and club'ish. Especially since the Wharf is only a 10 minute drive and the prices in the establishment on the waterfront are relatively lower for both alcohol and food. I got the catfish and grits, the catfish was seasoned quite well however, they nearly give you 3 cups of grits and a little sauce and charged either $32 or $37 for 2 filets and a whole bunch of unseasoned grits. My advice to the establishment, I see why those girls were twerking in your Dallas location because the music is set to ratchet/club level and that doesn't give off classy in the slightest. I don't mind the ratchet music but, lowering the volume would be ideal so people can have a conversation and hear their server."

I find the place charming -- cozy with a cosmopolitan vibe -- the perfect place for a business lunch with folk who are colleagues + friends. The staff is warm and welcoming, very much the Southern hospitality I knew growing up. My restrictive dietary needs were accommodated in a friendly way. (I do hope a vegan protein will be added in the near future, which would seal the deal.) I especially enjoyed the sauteed cauliflower. My guests who are more omnivorous raved about the vegan bowl with catfish, and the lobster mashed potato! Kudos to Kevin Kelly, big thanks to the hostess who seated us, to our server who was so attentive, and to the Assistant General Manager Niara who went the extra mile to make sure that every aspect of the experience was wonderful."

Immediately upon entering the esthetics catch your eye and make you want to pull out your camera. Even the dinnerware has its own flare. Our sever was all smiles and very attentive. Dusse’ is my favorite drink and it tends to be the go to there. (Which is mostly the reason I came) I was given a sample of the peach Dusse’’ , one of their signature drinks. It wasn’t my cup of tea ( I don’t like peaches) so I opted for the Remy hurricane, which did not disappoint! It wasn’t too sweet and had the RIGHT amount of liquor!  Everything is ala carte, which I love because we get to share/taste everything…duhhhh. We had braised short rib, mashed potatoes, chicken fried steak, collards and black eyed peas. 🤤🤤🤤. EVERYTHING WAS DELICIOUS! An experience was had! Can’t wait to go back!"

We had a 8:15PM reservation and we arrived on time to only be told we wouldn't be seated until a table becomes available. We were finally able to sit at our table around 9:00PM. Our table was right in the front by the door and it was a little disappointing.\nOur server Emani was great and she was super kind. Very knowledgeable about the menu. We placed our drink order,  Drinks took another 30 minutes. (4 of the signature cocktails came to about $90. YIKES.) Only to receive watered down cocktails that lacked alcohol. We placed our food order, only to be told our order never made it to the kitchen (probably the handheld machine technology default not our waitresses fault.) Emani accommodated us with free frozen shots and cornbread (around 9:15PM). Dinner finally arrived around 9:52PM. Here's what we ordered:\nCaesar Salad - regular\nFried Green Tomatoes - do not recommend\nFried pickles with ranch - NO MA'AM\nCatfish and grits - super salty. hard grits and lumpy\nCajun Pasta - nice and good portion.\nShrimp and Grits - overly salty. had to return to the kitchen\nAppetizer trio - lamb chop over cooked (asked medium), crab cake was nice and the two deviled eggs.\nAll sides were al la carte (typical) but they arent shareable size, so we opt'd out to not order them. The table next to us, had the same complaints and the lobster Mac n' Cheese, was loose and overly salty.\nImmediate thoughts: Due to our food not being put in, we believe we received reheated food which seem to make everything super salty. Its loud in there and not a dining place for you to have dinner and chat. They do not honor reservation times, at all.Another overhyped restaurant with the same quality aesthetics but mid quality food. We, the people, are tired of Jerk everything, fried everything, cajun pasta, and lamb chops. Also the prices aren't listed on the menu on the websit"

It's fried chicken, which wasn't seasoned at all.  My guest and I also ordered the dream egg appetizer; the shrimp was hard, but seasoned. The deviled egg had no seasoning, no tang to the deviled cream , no relish, very bland.  The salmon bites were over cooked, the fried pickles had no flavor other than the pickle itself.   The lobster mash had no flavor.  The banana pudding was so loose to the point of liquid.  \nThe dress code is definitely not enforced; women were dressed explicitly.  The music was too loud, we couldn't really talk, we have to yell over the music.  My reservation was for 7, but we weren't seated until 735.   \nA 20% gratuity is added to split between the staff, but the server states that we can to extra for just her.   I'm not comfortable with that tacticb at all.   It's definitely a tactic on the part of the restaurant.   The we spent almost) $300 and the food was very mediocre.   My daughter visited the Dallas location and had a great experience stating the food was excellent.   They're may be inconsistencies with the chefs because my experience is vastly different.   Other reviews indicated that the food was salty, well they may have overcompensated by not seasoning at all.  Also, the waitress did not recommend the Mac and cheese because she said it had to set and was too runny.  She also said the sweet potatoes were too sweet.   Maybe they were running out, I'm not sure, but to tell a guest not to order an item was odd.  I will never return to that location."

Heard mixed reviews about this place but I’m glad we still went because everything we ordered was good!!! Price point is a little higher than other place’s offering very identical dishes, but I’m guessing it’s more because of the plating and presentation than anything else. Would definitely return and try more dishes. My ONLY complaint, like many many others, TURN THE MUSIC DOWN!!!! I Couldn’t hear ANYTHING my waiter said nor my date and he had to move from sitting across from me to next to me. I noticed the speaker placement is close in the ceiling but my overall experience would have been so much better if the music wasn’t so loud. Other than that, I had a great time!"

The rice in the gumbo was hard and old but they did replace it with new gumbo. The flavor was good but it was too much rice and not enough gumbo.\nNow the catfish was good 8/10, the fried chicken wasn’t worth the price. They should give you a half chicken not a quarter for the price. The collard greens were about a 7.8/10, the sweet potatoes were yummy 9/10. Only reason why we won’t go back is because it seems overpriced for what you get."

Different people would bring our food (not always Lisa), but Lisa would immediately follow up to make sure everything was right. \n\nMinor downsides: the music got too loud as the night progressed and I was yelling to have a conversation. I didn’t mind as much because it was good music. Also, they seem to be short on silverware and only bring out a fork or spoon based on your order. We had to ask multiple times for additional silverware throughout the courses. Despite this, I’ll be back and am considering using their catering service because the food is just that good."

HOWEVERRRRRRRRR. this is not a typical restaurant. it’s phenomenal.\n\neveryone was enjoying themselves. full house on a random wednesday. Super super kind and hard working staff, (although it seemed you could use a couple more servers or perhaps smaller sections for your servers to be able to get all table’s needs met) great ambiance, all patrons were having a great time, the vibe inside is elevated and glamorous.\n\nwish the main room was slightly quieter (a bit echoey).\n\ngreat great great job. clearly a hot spot, and its obvious why.

In DC, the new law is that restaurants must tell you, before eating, if gratuity will be automatically added to the bill so that you can decide whether you want to patronize the restaurant. I didn't find out until the end that a 20% gratuity had already been added for my party of two."

I ordered the a la cart lamb chops (medium rare) and of the 4, 1 was cooked about medium, one medium well, and two well done. I did ask that the two well done chops be recooked (I could tolerate the other two but ended up not eating them) but when the recooked lamb chops came out one lamb chop was completely rare just seared on the outside and the other was well done again... so that was frustrating and I left without eating my food and had to eat elsewhere. The drinks however were awesome! I had the peach duce frozen drink and my husband had a special drink called the 21 questions. They were great. The ambiance was really nice, cute decor... some of the younger tables were really loud, twerking in the floor etc. but I kind of expected that so I wasn't too annoyed. We spent $245 for two meals  (one of which was not edible) and 3 drinks and another 25 for valet, so that's why I have a low score for value..."

The service wasn’t necessarily as prompt and there were a few issues with timeliness of food but I understood they had just opened and were quite busy. I didn’t enjoy this dinner experience as much. The place was busy and loud,service was average,the food was too salty,and everything felt overpriced as though I was paying more for the atmosphere than the experience itself. The waitress even failed to mention there would be a charge for water and I didn’t know until we received the bill,and I saw an $11 charge,again, just for water. I’m disappointed because I was super excited for this restaurant coming to DC as I love the one in Dallas,but I fear it may fall into the category of another overpriced restaurant where I’m paying more for the grass wall and neon signs than I am for an enjoyable,dining experience."

I was seated quickly and tended to within minutes by my waitress, Dani. The blackberry margarita was perfect! I’d definitely try it again. I had the deviled eggs with shrimp as an appetizer and those tasted amazing. The shrimp were seasoned to perfection. For my entree, I had the southern fried chicken with hot honey sauce on the side, per the recommendation from Dani. I enjoyed it better that way honestly. For my sides I had the mac and cheese, greens, and sweet potatoes, all of which tasted great and were seasoned well. I appreciated how the greens have smoked turkey instead of ham. For my second drink I had the D’Usse peach frosé which also was tasty. I enjoyed the ambiance and my friend enjoyed her food as well. She really loved the black eyed peas, as it reminded her of home. I’d definitely return and would try dessert!"

The patron margarita and the dusse peach frozen drinks come in the bottle and are $37. Although we didn’t share we realized we could have because of the size.

She was on top of every request and just exceeded expectations. 10/10 for her, for sure.\n\nThe food was great - but to me, it consistently is. I was surprised that my greens didn’t have turkey meat, but our server said it was just the batch. Still yum, though. Just not the norm. I already have plans to be back on Friday. Meet me there! :)\n\nSo happy to see a hometown hero thriving in dc!"

We waited for 3-4 minutes to be seated. Suggestion: maybe they can have two host working that area. Someone can handle to phone and the other can seat the guests. Possibly rotate. In the placement napkin you will only receive a fork. The food is overly seasoned. If you get the Kajun Kreamy Pasta beware that they use a lot of butter. My pasta came out very oily and the the deep fried crab leg didn’t look appealing. Our waiter was extremely nice. But, she did let us know up front that if we didn’t like our food that we’re not able to send it back. I didn’t enjoy my food at all. I think they should focus on their food options and the customers feed back rather than the aesthetic of the restaurant. They don’t have a lot of options for vegans or vegetarians. The drinks are amazing and the ambiance is up to par. I’m sure I won’t be back."

Cute and inviting. Downhill after that. The music was on but we couldn't here what was playing just background noise really. Customer service was mediocre and lackluster along with the minimal entree choices. The mac and cheese tasted like it was from a box with added black pepper. The catfish was thin and over breaded with panko, the greens were okay but nothing to be desired. The lollipop lamb chops where extremely spicy and tough because they were not cook properly. Drinks were okay. Everything was overpriced and al a carte. They charged us for sauce that they provide for the dish but we wanted it on the side. It was watery and not with the price. We had to ask for additional napkins which were cocktail napkins and black (which rubs off on the skin) no linen and we were given forks but no knives.  It unfortunate but I don't plan on returning or going to the new one scheduled to open in Baltimore. I drove to D.C. to be disappointed and overspend for a mediocre experience."

Best expresso martini I’ve ever had but about 23$. Food was amazing! Again, a litttle overpriced. But all in all, if you want a turn up Saturday for food, drinks, and a party-like feel with your friends, this is the place."

The restaurant is very instagram post worthy; however, the fine dining experience that it tries to evoke doesn't deliver.  Doormen welcome you with a smile and grace.  Front entrance has the floral walls worthy of insta pics yet the inside is very dark (walls, ceilings, furniture).  The music is excessively loud to the extent that you can't have a conversation without yelling.  Seating for 4 doesn't allow diners to sit under the table confortably without being at an awkward angle.  \n\nWhile the servers are very personable and accomodating, I believe further training is needed (i.e. a steak knife being placed in advance of entree delivery).  Started with a 'goldfashion' made with Dusse, beautiful presentation; however, taste nothing like an old fashion.  We both ordered the steak & eggs, when inquiring about the type of cheese offered for the eggs, we were told that they were out of cheese.  In a fine dining experience, I don't understand how that happens.  The cut of the ribeye steak was not the best as even at a medium temperature, the steak was difficult to cut and chew in addition to being thinner then expected for a ribeye.  The side of potatoes were extremely salty and almost inedible.  \n\nOverall, there is definitely room for improvement.  I believe the price point and the hype doesn't match the fine dining experience expected and delivered."

Again, the customer service was great bc when I asked to be moved bc the music in one room was ridiculously loud they sat us in a way better spot 👍🏾. \nIt just may have been my server although great personality, as a customer there for the first time it’s good to have someone share these things with upfront so you don’t have to figure them out on your own after the fact.

The music was good, not too loud, but just enough. Our waitress was AMAZING! She made us feel right at home and was on top of her customer service and telling us about the business and it's vision. She was completely vested in the company and it's mission and that spoke volumes. The only complaint I would have is the automatic gratuity charges. I know it takes a team, but single handedly, our waitress deserved to have her tips and gratuities all to herself without having to split it with everyone, but we did give her extra because she sold the vision. We will be back when traveling!"

In addition they charge a mandatory 20% gratuity but also request that you tip the waiter separately.

The candied yams were cooked perfectly.\n\nLows: We waited 60mins for our water, appetizers, and cocktails. My blackberry mojito was completely tart and was missing sugar cane or any sweetener. I suffered through it and did not return it. I gave them a second chance with the Rum punch drink.  The server bought me a drink without any alcohol in it. After complaining I was asked was it too \"weak\". I showed her the photo of the drink from their website. It was clearly a \"fruit punch\" beverage with fresh fruit atop. She then offered a shot of rum for my punch. Finally, the bar remade my entire drink.\n\nMy catfish entree was forgettable. Collard greens were bland.\n\nOverall: We watched tables that arrived after us get their food and drink before us. When we asked management for an explanation they offered us one free dessert to share and one comp for appetizer. That is not an explanation for the issues. So, it made me feel there was an assumption our issue could be remedied by decreasing our \"expenses\" and not addressing their efficiency. The fact they charge for water we waited an hour for...Unbelievable! I have eaten at high-end and exclusive establishments. I have never been charged for flat water. Needless to say, I do not recommend. Highly disappointed."

Our server explained the menu to a T. One of the drinks we wanted the server said we couldn’t order yet we seen another table order right after we got our drinks (which took 45 minutes). The food took an hour after we got our drinks which was frustrating trying to down a frozen drink but on a empty stomach while waiting so long. Our server never came to update our table on why the food was taking so long, to check on us or anything. The food was extremely salty. I love me a good seasoned entree but it was way too much. We couldn’t taste the deviled eggs because of all the seasonings. Our server also spilled our drink and didn’t offer a new one or anything. I would definitely try them again maybe at a later time during the week for dinner. We love to support our own. Also the 20% gratuity added makes the servers work not as hard because they know they’ll make good money and I’ll love to over tip I just wish the service was better. I also wish we seen a manager stop by tables to update us or something. Hope to see you all prosper in the future"

They had a drink that comes in a Dusse bottle that was delicious and really the only drink you need.\n\nCon: The jerk chicken was dry and the fried fish was fried too hard. Given the Dusse drink was the best drink on the menu, I wish the waiter would have led with a sample of the popular drink before we ordered drinks, so we could’ve just ordered it first verses having to buy it afterwards. I felt like I wasted money on the first drink after having tasted the Dusse drink."

I expected a more classier atmosphere. Once we were finally seated and ordered its now after 10pm. Now the food was great even though my cousin Seafood Pasta was given to her cold.

We all enjoyed our food but my Louisiana catfish and grits was super salty.  My friend got the regular catfish with a side dish and she said hers was fine so perhaps it was the sauce the fish/grits were smothered in.  The drinks were all good but not heavy on the alcohol except for the Dusse' drink which my friend said had a good amount.  The fried pickle appetizer was tasty but also very salty.  Overall we enjoyed the food and found it being served timely and friendly.\n\nAs MANY other reviewers have noted the music is WAY TOO LOUD! I don't mean slightly elevated but LOUD ... like club loud.  It's disappointing - just because it's black owned with a predominantly black clientele doesn't mean it has to have urban club/go-go vibes.  The atmosphere could be moderate upscale casual but this just misses the mark.  There are small tweaks that could elevate this space and I hope they do so.  The price point for the drinks and food certainly seem as if they are upscale casual but the environment is not quite there.\n\nI wish them the best and hope they take the constructive feedback and make adjustments so they become a staple in DC."

        "review_text": "First time diner here this week, definitely wanted to experience this highly anticipated place. (My husband had gone to the Dallas location) They have valet and a doorman which I loved and prepared me for an elevated, classy experience. As soon as you walk in, you see the the flower walls and overall sophisticated decor, which is a nice touch and stands out. Really nice bar too. (For my locals, this is the old Toro Toro restaurant right by The Park) I appreciate trendy, sleek decor like that when dining out. Greeters quickly welcome you with smiles and get you seated, so no issues there. Within about 2-3 mins our super nice waitress came over and started drink/app orders, great. The music is lively but may have been too intense for early dinner vibes (rap songs going with the cursing, thinking of the kids, older folks and types of clientele that will eventually attract) but then it switches to a slow nice RnB song. This is the main part for me...the food didn't wow as I expected. My pasta dish came out semi warm and I paid full price for the vegetarian version (which had no veggies added, just pasta and sauce) the Mac and cheese was underwhelming and my husbands food was just OK, per him. The drinks were good though and presented pretty too. My peach cobbler dessert was good. I wanted to be more impressed but I also believe in trying things more than once to know for sure and to support this BOB, So I'll be back for the breakfast type food. (Sounded and looked really good on the menu) Also, the bill for 2 was around $330 before tip (and I didn't drink alcohol myself) so prepare to spend for the experience. Overall, I recommend coming to visit K&K, but come sooner then later to see for yourself. If you know like I do, nice things in DC get ruined quickly by certain crowds. :-)"

I gave a lot of lenience because the restaurant just opened a month ago.\nThe restaurant is beautiful, picture worthy. The service from the gentleman opening the doors to the hostesses to our server was amazing. My food was really good. I had the short ribs it was tender and juicy the gravy was awesome and the veggies were tender and flavorful overall a solid plate. My husband thought that the chicken was just ok but that the greens where great. Our friends had the catfish with mac & greens and the lamb chops with the lobster. The catfish was just ok, the mac had a good ratio of cheese to noodle but was lacking in seasoning. The lamb chops/lobster was given a high rating for flavor and portion size. Overall the food was good.\n\nThe pricing of the food was consistent with any other upscale dining establishment in DC. I didn't feel like it was over priced like some places I've been to. The drinks were great a bit pricey still consistent with DC bar prices. \n\nNow, the problem comes in with how the restaurant gives you 2 hours to dine without room for error. They are literally kicking you out of your seat at the 2 hour mark, which does not give a great dining experience. I was very upset about being rushed to get up after paying a $420 bill. I even asked to speak to the manager, unfortunately she was the worst, she started rambling about brunch which had nothing to do with our reservation. She ended with stating that the 2 hour time limit starts at the time of your reservation regardless of what time you are seated, for us that was 5:15 and being asked to leave at 7 because a big party was coming in. Which to me is insane. I get the point but it doesn't offer the customer a great first experience. For me it totally turned me off to the point that I will not return. If that's something that you can handle its a beautiful place and the food is good."

She provided great recommendations in which we did enjoy! The Appetizer Trio was certainly a hit. To have a bit of variety at the table, we ordered the lamb chop breakfast platter, chicken and waffles, and the catfish. Everything was tasty, but the catfish could use a little less breading. It took away from the flavor a bit. We enjoyed the mimosa tower because we usually indulge in a bottomless mimosa brunch, and this was a great alternative. We are so happy that we didn’t allow other negative reviews to prevent us from dining here. We enjoyed our drinks, food, the staff and the VIBE! I would dine here again for sure!"

Once seated, the waiter provided helpful information about the menu, but unfortunately, it wasn't easy to hear him over the DJ's music. Nevertheless, he continued to check on us throughout our meal.\n\nFor my appetizer, I ordered the deviled eggs with shrimp on top, and for my main course, I ordered the shrimp and grits with fried lobster, which came with a side of collards. However, I encountered an issue with the taste of the food as it was excessively salty, and I was unable to consume it. I agree with previous reviews that the price was quite steep for the mediocre quality of the meal. The shrimp I received were of a basic size, whereas for the cost of $61, I expected them to be jumbo or at least prawns. Additionally, the lobster turned out to be rather tough and unpleasant to eat.\n\nThis was a one-and-done for me."

Our server whose name I can’t remember did an excellent job…she offered drink recommendations and was very attentive. The music was LOUD…we could barely hear our server, and forget about having a private conversation. I love to hear good music during a weekend brunch, but that was a bit too loud for a sit down dining experience. The food was just ok to me…I had the traditional chicken and waffles and my companion had shrimp and grits…he loved his food. I had to send my first chicken breast back because it wasn’t done on the inside. The manager came out to apologize and they brought out a new piece quickly. There was also a photographer there randomly showing up at tables to capture the experience, I guess. That’s understood BUT he should be invisible to guests not all over your shoulder while you’re trying to enjoy the experience. I was very excited to try this restaurant, and I’m glad I did. Service was great, restaurant aesthetics were awesome and hopefully, they’ll work out the minor kinks to make the overall experience better."

Chicken was moist-had solid seasoning but was not spicy (we ordered the Nashville hot). Gumbo had great depth of flavor with a good amount of meat. Drinks were well balanced and not too juicy. Customer service was good with a few notes.\n\nNotes: I will return but some points that accumulated to -1 star. My guests ordered off the wrong menu that was provided on the table card. There were two QR codes on the table. One has the full menu. The other has dinner only. We were there for brunch. That caused the waiter to wait longer to explain what was available on the brunch menu as we were ordering. Our guests were under the assumption they had the same menu as us. Note for service: please remove the appetizer plates off the table before bringing out the entrees. We had to scramble and make room which is annoying at this price point. My glass had a smudge on the lip area. Please pour the water for the guests on the first round at least.\n\nThe shrimp and grits were very thick but smooth—needs something, it’s boring. Whether it’s some spice or sharper cheese-it needs something. I will not be ordering that again.\n\nThe oxtails had a lovely gravy with ample amount on the rice. So yummy! They were trimmed perfectly with little to no fat. Very meaty pieces were provided.\n\nJerk lamb-I will order this again when I return! The jerk spice was so tasty and well developed!\n\nCrab cake- had a great amount of crab meat! Overall, it tasted pretty good. I’ve had better but at least they didn’t skimp on the meat."

The entrees were tried were the chicken and waffles and the braised short rib, again the food was well seasoned. We did the rum punch for our drink choice and they were good as well. Overall, the food and drinks were good but the service was a little slow. All the staff was very friendly but the servers seemed overwhelmed running in between their different sections. Since the restaurant is still new and receiving a lot of attention on social media, I would say to extend some grace when you go. Literally all the staff is working hard and doing their best as they find their rhythm."

We ordered an appetizer and they brought the entree out before the app. We just told them to keep it. Then to finish it off, they had some contractors in there trying to take measurements right next to our table. Definitely need to improve.

My lunch partner enjoyed her Hennessy wings and waffles as well , although  she summoned the chef and requested that the waffles be cooked a little longer.\n\nMy complaint is the pricing and service fees. First of all we were not informed that we had to pay for the water that was basically shoved down our throats. When I inquired after noticing the $11 charge in the bill, the waitress simply said that they do not intervene when offering the water. That is trickery. We should have been told that there was a charge for the water.  Also, a $20 service fee for two guests? A $132 bill for lunch with no alcoholic beverages. Gratuity was not included. The pricing is a little absurd."

It was me and my wife’s 15yr wedding anniversary so I wanted the evening to be special. The experience wasn’t bad but it definitely could have been better. Our food was given to the wrong table and then we were asked to take another order that was similar to ours. After we agreed we were than told my wife’s food would come out first because if we waited for my order hers would get cold. The wait was extremely long between appetizers and the main course. My pet peeve is when you see the staff cleaning up while your eating. If I’m not mistaken the chef and staff left before we even got our meal even though the waiter told us the chef was personally making our dish. So we shared my wife’s food so we could eat together….not good. And for a Monday the music was so loud people were basically yelling to each other so they could hear. The staff said they were used to it… I would maybes try it another time but honestly I would have gone to Capital Grille for a more intimate dinner."

The bartenders made Makers Old fashions so that was plus. As a self proclaimed experience junkie and social butterfly I will say its not only aseptically pleasing but actually good.

I will lead with saying my 15+ years of restaurant experience causes me to be a tough critic and no so easy to please but this spot got it right! First off the decor is beautiful! From the moment you walk in you feel you’ve entered a fine dining establishment! The hostess was friendly and seemed well trained. The dining room is set up thoughtfully were as the tables are not too close together. Our server was bomb! She was a little busy but was sure to touch our table to greet us and let us know she’ll be right with us and came back with complimentary shots of their frozen Dussè peach drink (also bomb). We ordered that as our cocktail which comes in the actual Dussè bottle. For apps I ordered the Dream eggs (deviled eggs topped with blackened shrimp) and my friend ordered the fried salmon bites. For entrees I ordered the jerk lamb chops with collard greens + yams my friend got the fried chicken with yams + black eye peas. Everything was soooo good! There were so many options on the menu I wanted to try I will definitely be back! One or the things I noticed was the attention to detail from the staff. Constantly walking around making sure the space stays tidy, addressing any messes immediately, touching the table to make sure we’re ok or if we needed anything, and also providing unprovoked updates on the status of our food (it took a little while to come out but the point is not once did we have to ask “where’s my dinner?!”). It really was just a great experience, please go if you get the chance you will not be disappointed!!"

        "review_text": "K&K DC was a far different experience than K&K Chicago.  I will review K&K DC first.\nThe restaurant is beautiful. The waitress/waiters were friendly and informative as far as knowing about menu items.  The gumbo was very salty and was returned. The fried catfish was salty and was replaced with Shrimp and Grits. The lamb chops were hot! They must have marinaded them too long in the Jerk sauce.  I was disappointed in K&K DC because K&K Chicago was so good. We had visited Chicago location a week earlier.\n\nK&K Chicago gumbo was really good and the lamb chops were amazing! There was a hint of jerk seasoning on them.  They did not burn your lips, mouth, palate.  The jerk flavor did not overtake the flavor of the lamb chop like in DC.  In DC , the lamb chops could have been any meat all you tasted was jerk seasoning and your tongue was “assaulted” with heat.\n\nDrinks at both restaurants was good.  I really enjoyed the Peach D’usse Frose .  I love that the waitress offer you a taste of their signature drinks.  The Blackberry Margarita and Patron Mango Margarita was very tasty as well.\n\nWe did let several employees know about the food in DC and one of the cooks came to the table to speak with us.  She was very kind and did not seem to be very offended because we thought the food was either salty or too spicy (lamb chops).\n\nI will most likely go back but I will definitely wait a few months for DC to get their flavors together.  It was only their 2nd weekend being opened.\n\nOne last thing on K& K DC, our waitress, Taylor, was doing a really good job waiting on our table UNTIL she was assigned a group table of about 16 people.  From that moment on we had several people coming to our table because she had been assigned too many tables .  I strongly suggest that for groups of 10 or more, waiters/waitress be assigned only that group.  Taylor had the 4 people at my table feeling welcomed and special until she could no longer give us attention due to the large group she was assign"

My coworker really enjoyed herself and was really happy she could take the rest of her drink in a \"to go\" container. My overall rating for this place would be a.2.75...The place is gorgeous and very \"Instagrammable\" The ambience is more like a lounge than an upscale restaurant and the food is good but not swoon worthy for the price or the experience I had..I would rather go to LaVie @ the Wharf.

I had 3 lamb chops that came out cooked at 3 different temps. So much food was sent back, I almost wonder if they re-plated food on my plate. We sent our food back. We were served twice without utensils. The owner was there but did not seem to care about all the complaining patrons."

I was greeted by a beautiful backdrop and a courteous host whom I told I had reservations and she offered to take my pictures. The food is extremely pricey but suits the occasion and location for business.\n\nI was disappointed by the charge for 7$ sparking water and extra $3 for a side of sauce. I guess the price went up for EVERYTHING. My drink experience was pleasant I ordered the New Flame and it’s was hella damn spicy whew! My banana pudding waffles had no bananas or pudding smh. A dash of crumbled whatever breading was on top and to put the icing on the cake my chicken had HAIRS on them. The temperature of my food was cool. \n\nIn closing I had a nice experience except those details. I would try one more time just because and I do recommend you try for yourself. Magnificent ambience and service. Restroom was clean and tidy but again they were just opening. Best Wishes to them and order UP!"

        "review_text": "Excited for a Dallas favorite opening in DC. Made reservations for opening weekend . The restaurant is very aesthetically pleasing and Instagrammable, however I dine out, to eat not just for pictures. We waited 20min before our server came over, it was over 30mins before we received water. Our server was Deja, who was pleasant but not very attentive, and forgetful. We started with appetizers of gumbo & dreamy eggs. The gumbo came out first, it looked nothing like the menu photo. It also tasted very gritty & not like gumbo at all. The flavors weren’t cohesive. My deviled eggs never arrived 15mins later, I had to ask the server & she mentions salmon bites, which I never ordered, which lead me to believe she never ordered the eggs. While waiting for my appetizer, the side of okra I ordered with my entree randomly appeared. The runner saw no other food on our table and we questioned why the okra was coming out without our meal but she left it anyway. My dreamy eggs finally arrived. They used the tiniest eggs for huge shrimp. The shrimp were seasoned & cooked perfectly, deviled egg, itself bland. The yolk should be seasoned, as well. For entrees we ordered surf & turf, seafood pasta, greens, fried okra & Mac & cheese, which came out almost an hour after we ordered them. I ordered my lamb chops medium well, they came out rare. Fried lobster was thumb size but tasty. Mac & cheese is not baked, it’s watery stove top , powered cheese, give me velveeta vibes, definitely not Southern mac & cheese. Fried okra was seasoned well & we did receive a fresh order with our entrees. Side portion sizes and price point are a mismatch for $11 -$29 they should be shareable especially since all entrees are a la carte. For drinks we had the Dusse Frozen Peach, it was good but didn’t taste like the sample we were given. Also seemed to be sitting at the bar for a while as it was partially melted. Almost two hours for a meal that didn’t meet our expectations. I came hungry & left hungry."

They just open in the DC area and I was happy to check it out.\n\nThe moment my party and I walked in, we were greeted by the host and seated right away. Our server Heaven was sweet however, our experience here was underwhelming. Service was extremely slow. They had a lot of employees available but I still didn’t know why things were slow. At some point, I saw a group of employees standing around not doing much.\n\nWe asked for water the moment we sat down which came out 35 minutes later. We did not have straws, I had to walk to the bar to get straws for my table. There were no silverware at our table, I kept reminding our server for silverware politely. Our food took way too long to come out, and when it did, it was only one order. We were a party of three, and we were hoping all three of our meals will come out at the same time but no, the remaining of us had to wait for our food to come out.\n\nOverall, the food and drinks were amazing. They gave us complementary shots, which was really nice of them. This place has so much potential, so I’m really hoping they improve on their service."

Our server (God forgive me for not being able to recall her name) was WONDERFUL! The food, drinks and music were all incredible. Great ambiance and decor. The restaurant was running like a well-oiled machine on it’s opening weekend. The staff were all energetic and ON! Had the Deviled eggs, which were possibly the best I’ve ever had and the oxtails were incredible too! We also loved the peach frozen D’usse drinks. Chatted with the manager (I believe here name was Niama) who is a part of the restaurant’s DNA having managed in Chicago and Texas before. She also allowed us a sneak peak of the soon coming lounge on the lower level which is gorgeous and will surely be a smash hit!. Brunch was also extended beyond 2pm to 3:30, which was a PLUS! We wanted to eat more (I was eyeing the catfish) decided to order nothing else, because we knew we would surely be back! An absolute pleasant dining experience. Kudos to you Kitchen + Kocktails! You guys are killing it! Be back soon!"

The server was nice; however, she wasn’t very attentive.  The fried pickles were good.  The catfish didn’t taste seasoned at all.  The jerk lamb chops came out cold so the grease was able to settle.  We were not able to enjoy them.  By the time I received the s&p for my eggs which I thought were powdered but the weren’t, my eggs were cold.  The potatoes were meh. The waffles were delicious and would definitely order them again. The peach cobbler was a mouth full of cinnamon and granulated sugar.

Kitchen and Kocktails, located in NW, Washington, DC\n\nI went for their late dinner service and For its opening weekend, The place was jumping! I wouldn’t recommend bringing your sneaky link here because you will get spotted\n\nThey have a lounge downstairs and two private rooms that you can rent out for parties.\n\nAesthetics wise they win. They’re Untouchable.\nThey took the flower wall to a new level with their staircase. Definitely dress to impress and get you a nice photo op\n\nThe service was superb. Before I could ask for anything they were checking in with me! Truly a top tier experience!\n\nI loved my drink. it was sweet without being syrupy and and the presentation was everything.\n\nFor apps, i tried the salmon bites, crab cakes, and the shrimp deviled eggs.\n\nThe Deviled eggs with blackened shrimp were loaded with flavor and the eggs were the perfect texture\n\nThe salmon bites are also a great. Crunchy on the outside with juicy salmon on the inside. The sauce was not your average ketchup/mayo blend. It was hitting\n\nThe Crab cake had no flavor and some shells in it, so skip the crab cake and head to Baltimore for one of those\n\nFor entrees I tried the surf and turf with lamb chops and fried lobster and the hot honey chicken and a side of Mac and cheese\n\nThe jerk lamb chops were outstanding! They were spicy with a kick at the end but the sauce cools it down if the spice is too much for you\n\nThe hot honey chicken was really good but The price point was kinda crazy. It came with two whole wings and no sides for $25\n\nAnd The Mac and cheese was just cheese and noodles. It was also watery and unseasoned so I’d pass on that one too.\n\nI think the most disappointing part for me was the Lobster tail. It was supposed to be fried but it was Mushy and the Breading wasn’t cooked all the way through.\n\nThis was there opening weekend and I’m sure they have kinks to get out"

My husband and I will definitely come back to try the brunch.\n\nIt was opening weekend and with that said our waiter “Z” was very professional, welcoming, and doing the best she could.\n\nThe kitchen seemed to be very backed up.\n\nWhen we came in at 7:32 pm we were told by a hostess that we would only have 1.5 to dine. I know places that have 2hr limits, but to have appetizers, more than one drink, and your dinner seems to me to feel a little rushed.\n\nWhen we were able to order, We were not kept to that time frame of 1.5hr bc of the long wait for our food and drinks. We waited over 30 mins for drinks and I have no idea how long it took for our food to come.\n\nI had the Asian Hennessy pork chop(I believe that was the exact name) they were good overall but not as warm as I would have liked.\n\nThe ambiance was nice & I loved they had a DJ. The drinks were not as pretty as I would have expected for the cost and the fact they are called “kitchen & kocktails”.\n\nMy biggest issue was that the tables are a bit short for the chairs they have so we couldn’t slide all the way up to the table and comfortably put our legs under.\n\nBut again it was opening weekend and I will be back to give it another go. Thx “Z” again for your service and great Attitude."

From when we approached the front doors, to the hostess stand, to the table, everyone greeted us and made it clear that they were happy to have us as guests.\n\nThe person serving us was very friendly and helpful and we never had to lift a finger to even refresh our glasses of bottled still water.  The food was flavorful and the energy was high.  My wife had jerk chicken with mac and cheese, and greens.  I had the fried fish and grits with blacked eyed peas.\n\nIn addition to the downstairs lounge for after dinner drinks, everyone with whom we interacted, including the owner Mr. Kevin Kelley himself, made us feel that there was no other place we should be.\n\nWe will definitely visit this location again when we return to the D.C. area."

Beautifully decorated, food was very good (a little spicy kick to some of the meats, so kee that in mind when ordering), the cocktails and service were also phenomenal. My only critique was the music was really loud. Granted the playlist was fire, but I don’t enjoy screaming at my guests over dinner."

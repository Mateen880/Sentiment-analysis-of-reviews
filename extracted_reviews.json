The table we were seated at for 5 was very uncomfortable and truly not large enough to suit more than 2 people comfortably.

Then my husband was seated on the end of the table so we were all bumping knees. This also caused our  dinner place for the plate of dinner to not be immediately in front of us and was so uncomfortable. The food was delicious and our waiter Rafael was amazing, but the table sizes in relation to the seating used is not sufficient. The table itself is just too small. I wish that didn't negatively tant our experience, but it did. For the amount spent for the dinner and the ambiance of the restaurant, my party expected a better, more comfortable seating experience to enjoy our visit. My back literally started hurting from the awkward cramped seating. Please do better. Thank you.",

I ordered the hot honey chicken, it tasted like it had been cooked prior to and dipped back in the oil to re-heat and had the funny taste leftover chicken has. I was disappointed that beer wasn't an option there, only super sweet cocktails and a variety of wines. Overall, i was truly disappointed with the cost compared to the quality of food, as well as 20% gratuity was automatically added for horrible service. I will not be returning.",

This same attendant we called 15 minutes prior to our arrival for 6:30pm couldn’t remember exactly where we’d asked to be seated. She attempted to seat us in the wrong section of the restaurant. Then after realizing her mistake, she took us to our desired reservation seating. This is where the disaster begun. There were gnats and flies everywhere on the lower level of this restaurant. On top of that our waiter was being a complete a hole. Didn’t greet us with a warm welcome. Then after we expressed to him about the issue going on, he responded with the manager is busy right now. As if what we’re sharing with him about their restaurant wasn’t a major safety concern. Then once we spoke with the manager, he only offered to give us a credit for returning to dine of $50. That’s unacceptable and we couldn’t figure out why he couldn’t apply that credit to the bill from yesterday. After all of this my wife and I decided to cancel our food order because we sat for over an hour waiting to be served. Then once we requested the check our food was magically ready to be served. We will not be dining at your restaurant again for a couple of reasons. The two main ones would be cleanliness, and customer service. The restaurant is a fine establishment which we’ve eaten at before. This time it wasn’t a pleasurable experience because of management and staff.",

The reason I thought about taking my family to Kitchen and Kocktails was based on my first visit of being pleasantly surprised and impressed with everything.  This time was different.  First, the service was outstanding, and she was very helpful with answering questions regarding food choices.  Music - upon arrival the music was at an acceptable level, meaning you can hear each other without yelling.  However, once the music had to be restarted, the volume was at a Club level and drowned out everyone.  The staff had to be told to turn the volume down.  For a restaurant with such beautiful decor, the music selection and volume are questionable.   Next, I ordered the blackened salmon salad.  I would not recommend this selection.  The picture on the scanned menu is not what you will receive.  My food was presented in a large bowl with what appeared to be a bag of salad and a piece of salmon that can literally fit in the palm of your hand.  I sent it back to the kitchen and requested chicken and waffles. Be advised you are now asked if you want white meat or dark meat which changes the price.  My mom ordered chicken and cinnamon waffles, she rates it a 10/10. My Son ordered the jerk chicken and rates it 5/10 based on the chicken being non-spicy. He also order the mac and cheese and fries which are ala carte and charged separately. He rates the mac and cheese 9/10 and fries 0 due to no season.  Drinks - My mom and I ordered ice tea and it was ok. The taste was more like waterwith liquid sugar. My son ordered the patron frozen margarita and rates it 10/10.  We also ordered salmon bites and I rated it 4/10 due to over seasoned and salty.  The total bill for three people - $274 to include a mandatory 20% Service Fee.  Ambiance - beautiful.  Food - moderate to high depending your taste buds. Cost - $$$$.",

Zee told us all about the menu, what were the popular items, her favorites, the drinks, etc. I was impressed with her knowledge and professionalism.\r\n\r\nWe ordered the K&K omelet, traditional waffles, specialty waffles (they never made it to the table), the mimosa tower, appetizers, and much more.  Every food item was delicious!!! The mimosa tower was perfect for our table and the drinks in the tequila bottles were too cute.\r\n\r\nThe bill comes and here are the issues. The menu states a side of traditional waffles are $13, well they charged $17. I pointed this out to Zee and she said, there's nothing she can do because they can't change what the system automatically generates. I call BS, but they weren't willing to make the change. There is a 20% service charge so pay attention to your bill.\r\n\r\nHonestly,  I will probably go back because the food was good but slightly over priced.\r\n\r\nOh lastly, the women's bathroom only had one working toilet.

When we arrived to check in (on time might I add), they instructed us to wait down on the bottom level as our table was not ready and they didn’t want us waiting by the front entrance. We did as told and waited downstairs. 45 minutes passed and we still had not been seated. I went to the hostess to inquire if our table was ready and I was told “we came looking for you but couldn’t find you so we gave your table away.” I found it to be impossible that they came looking for a group of 12 people waiting downstairs. I never got a text notification or open table notification stating my table was ready, and no one came down looking for us. Needless to say, the birthday celebration was tainted by this experience as we had to leave since our table was given away. Yesterday I decided to give the restaurant another try. This time our waitress Sheena was incredible the music was really good as well. I ordered the fried catfish and grits and my friend ordered the fried salmon and grits. Both of our meals were overall salty. To the point we couldn’t enjoy our meal. Because if both of these experiences, I will not be eager to return to this restaurant.",

But this really takes away from the ability to have a relaxing meal and conversation with such wonderful food.  Our ears were ringing when we left because the music was sooo loud.  It is suggested that perhaps the tables can be spaced out better and while that may result in a few less tables on the floor, the customers may be happier.

Our waitress was really nice, but it troubles me to share that we ordered three appetizers that never made its way to our table.  We also asked for condiments that we did not get until our food was almost finished.  Note, the food was good.  I am happy to share K+K attempted to rectify the situation by taking 10% off each meal.\n\nLastly, I had to return the bill to be corrected, and to make matters worse, we were charged a whopping $42 SERVICE CHARGE (20%)… .   There was even a prompt for a TIP!  Bless there hearts… .☺️\n\nTo the owner(s) of the restaurant, I recommend lessening or eliminating the 20% service charge and make our young folks “EARN” their work through a genuine demonstration of QUALITY service.  Adding a 20% service charge to the bill is unfair to your customers who received subpar service.

The irony is even though service was bad (the server never checked on us), she told us if we tipped, she'd get the entire tip. I still do not know if the check amount was correct because she said she could not provide us with the itemized bill. All she did was show us the total on the handheld device. My brother and I split the bill. He felt obligated to tip 20%. I chose to tip 10% even though my cousin said to leave $0.

The bartender was pretty un attentive for the most part aside from a conversation she was having with another gentleman at the bar. After being sat our server, I hate that I forgot his name because he was the best part of the experience. I ordered his recommendations and the fried chicken was undercooked, the lamb was overcooked, and the mac and cheese needs seasoning. That's not the servers fault. He was honest and attentive. He even went the extra mile to return my earbud to me that I left at the table in my rush to leave.

Cons: I was not acknowledged by a wait staff member until 35+ minutes after being seated (not even offered water), the waitress was clearly overworked and had an attitude, the bathroom was filthy and didn’t have any hand soap, there is a mandatory 20% gratuity charge and the service was nowhere near justifying that amount, the party next to me waited an hour for their food which was brought out cold; this very polite and friendly coupled was pushed to the point of demanding a full refund and leaving hungry.

    "review_text": "My experience at K+K was not what I expected based on the reviews. Went here for brunch on New Year’s. The music and crowd were not too loud and people were dressed decent casual to slightly dressy. I parked on the street in front of the restaurant, which appeared to be mostly two hour parking and valet. Service was really nice/helpful but really slow. It took about 40 minutes after ordering to get our entrées. The people next to us sat 15 to 20 minutes before being greeted. My friends and I had salmon bites, chicken and waffles, and the catfish breakfast. Food was ok, not great. I’ve had much better brunch food at basic less expensive restaurants. It felt like our entrees were missing a sauce or topping or something that would have elevated the dishes. The drinks were definitely the highlight. We had the frozen margaritas and peach D’usse.. I’d give both an 8/10. Decor/ambiance was cute but gave that eerie nightclub during the day vibe due to the black walls and recessed lighting. I read in another review that this location used to be Toro Toro.. yes it definitely is the same place. We spent $100 each with gratuity. Overall I’d recommend K+K for drinks, and I’m guessing dinner is more impressive than brunch.",

The food was only slightly warm, pickles were way too salty and the grits had zero flavor. They did have a limited selection of wines but nothing by the glass and the bottles were extremely overpriced (having worked in the wine business). Average was $200-$400 for wines you can buy in the store for under $20. I will try the Dallas location next time. May just be the DC location that was lacking. However our waiter was great and tried his best to offer a good experience.",

Those were the best waffles I have ever had, I’m not exaggerating. The chef also brought out another flavor of waffles from the menu for me to try, and they were also delicious. Drinks were pretty and tasted good, but on the expensive side. Pricing is a bit high. On my check there was the chicken & waffles, 1 margarita and a bottled water. The total was $80. Neither of us were offered receipts or had a chance to see the charges so I’m not sure of the price breakdown.

The manager offered free refills of our lemonades and complimentary desserts. My food was ok. The fish is great however those unseasoned greens and fast food mac n cheese did not impress me for the price and the food was almost cold. In the end my server just kind of disappeared. Not really sure if she thought I was upset at the wait but I wasn’t going to take it out on her. At this point I am on hour 3 sitting here and I am ready to go. Asking for to go boxes and check was a chore. Then our complimentary dessert turned into one order and not one for each of us. I was not offered a receipt so I can’t even tell if I was charged accurately. I have a feeling the refills of the lemonade did not end up being complimentary. She took that hand held card reader so fast after my payment and ran off.

The southern fried chicken was just okay (nothing unique or bold about it, probably better with sauce on it)…didn’t eat most of it, the mac and cheese was also just okay (again, nothing particularly unique or bold)…I did eat it all though, and the greens were good (although more stalk than I would like).  Soul/southern food is tastes are so subjective and we usually were introduced to it through home cooking (granny, big mama). So, I’m usually not raving over restaurant soul food.  The service was great throughout, and the music was very good. I’d go back here if I were taking someone who was visiting from out of town.  It’s a great vibe and location.",

All in all I was extremely happy with everything. The drinks were a lil pricey being that I am from the south but they were great drinks So i had no issues.   Paid 11 or 12 for bottle water just because we didn't know there was free water but overall a great experience. Ra ked up a 400 bill but I didn't complain. Just wishing got free water.

Unfortunately the imagery was much better than the dining experience. It began with the valet being MIA for 20 minutes when we pulled up… come to find out he was sitting somewhere in a car… We finally get into the restaurant and we are seated 20 minutes before anyone comes to greet us at the table. After we order drinks we have to wave the server back over to the table to take our orders. I asked for a medium steak and it came out (30 mins later) cold and (very) well done... couldn’t find the waitress to send it back so had to flag down someone else for help. I asked for plain waffles and they came out with some type of caramel drizzle and powdered sugar... they were sent back and it took another 30 minutes for them to come back out. I asked for eggs scrambled WITH cheddar and they came out in a bowl scrambled with some cheddar sprinkled on the top (not throughout). Kept having to chase down the waitress because she was posted at the bar for our entire meal... for a meal that cost over $300, that should NOT have been the experience. Also they have some sort of service charge that is already factored in and with service like this, I should have been able to control what I paid for the service I received.\\n-1 star experience.\\nWould NOT recommend.'}\n",

The table we were seated at for 5 was very uncomfortable and truly not large enough to suit more than 2 people comfortably. Me and my daughter sat on the ends of the table and literally was forced with dresses on to sit uncomfortably with a table leg in between our legs during dinner. Then my husband was seated on the end of the table so we were all bumping knees. This also caused our  dinner place for the plate of dinner to not be immediately in front of us and was so uncomfortable. The food was delicious and our waiter Rafael was amazing, but the table sizes in relation to the seating used is not sufficient. The table itself is just too small. I wish that didn't negatively tant our experience, but it did. For the amount spent for the dinner and the ambiance of the restaurant, my party expected a better, more comfortable seating experience to enjoy our visit. My back literally started hurting from the awkward cramped seating. Please do better. Thank you.\",\n",

We were under 15 minutes late due to traffic and called in advance. We were assured that it was ok and was greeted politely upon arrival. They were ALL so kind... in spite of EVERYTHING going wrong.\\nIt was VERY crowded. We waited an hour to be seated. The crowd varied with multiple generations. Dress code: from sweat shirts to prom dresses. Shots were given out to accommodate the waiting crowd.\\nWe sat after nearly an hour of waiting. Our obviously overwhelmed waitress explained that the kitchen was backed up (allegedly 30 minutes) and suggested we put our orders in all at once. After sitting for an hour with NOTHING but water on our table, a VERY PRETTY and nice woman came to explain the delay, offering MORE SHOTS! 2 cubes of cornbread for 6 people came out, but no appetizer plates. We sliced it and used our hands as plates.\\nOur waitress was no where in sight for nearly an hour. 90 minutes in, a server bought out ONE of the six plates and we were told that the catfish and jerk chicken we ordered was no longer available... But, there were 2 tables that sat AFTER us and they were eating catfish and jerk chicken! In fact, one of those tables FINISHED and we still hadn\\'t eaten anything but cornbread! We placed substitute orders and our waitress finally appeared and said \"oh, there\\'s no more catfish or jerk chicken\"...*6 blank faces*\\nOver 2 hours in with 4 SHOTS EACH on empty stomacha, more food began to come out.

It was not good, ambience was terrible, and music was loud and full of explicit lyrics... highly inappropriate for such a beautiful restaurant with great reviews.  Extremely disappointing.

      "    \"review_text\": \"This experience was the worst by far my wife and I have ever experienced. Firstly upon arrival after paying for valet service. We were greeted by the front door attendant. This same attendant we called 15 minutes prior to our arrival for 6:30pm couldn’t remember exactly where we’d asked to be seated. She attempted to seat us in the wrong section of the restaurant. Then after realizing her mistake, she took us to our desired reservation seating. This is where the disaster begun. There were gnats and flies everywhere on the lower level of this restaurant. On top of that our waiter was being a complete a hole. Didn’t greet us with a warm welcome. Then after we expressed to him about the issue going on, he responded with the manager is busy right now. As if what we’re sharing with him about their restaurant wasn’t a major safety concern. Then once we spoke with the manager, he only offered to give us a credit for returning to dine of $50. That’s unacceptable and we couldn’t figure out why he couldn’t apply that credit to the bill from yesterday. After all of this my wife and I decided to cancel our food order because we sat for over an hour waiting to be served. Then once we requested the check our food was magically ready to be served. We will not be dining at your restaurant again for a couple of reasons. The two main ones would be cleanliness, and customer service. The restaurant is a fine establishment which we’ve eaten at before. This time it wasn’t a pleasurable experience because of management and staff.\",\n",

The reason I thought about taking my family to Kitchen and Kocktails was based on my first visit of being pleasantly surprised and impressed with everything.  This time was different.  First, the service was outstanding, and she was very helpful with answering questions regarding food choices.  Music - upon arrival the music was at an acceptable level, meaning you can hear each other without yelling.  However, once the music had to be restarted, the volume was at a Club level and drowned out everyone.  The staff had to be told to turn the volume down.  For a restaurant with such beautiful decor, the music selection and volume are questionable.   Next, I ordered the blackened salmon salad.  I would not recommend this selection.  The picture on the scanned menu is not what you will receive.  My food was presented in a large bowl with what appeared to be a bag of salad and a piece of salmon that can literally fit in the palm of your hand.  I sent it back to the kitchen and requested chicken and waffles. Be advised you are now asked if you want white meat or dark meat which changes the price.  My mom ordered chicken and cinnamon waffles, she rates it a 10/10. My Son ordered the jerk chicken and rates it 5/10 based on the chicken being non-spicy. He also order the mac and cheese and fries which are ala carte and charged separately. He rates the mac and cheese 9/10 and fries 0 due to no season.  Drinks - My mom and I ordered ice tea and it was ok. The taste was more like waterwith liquid sugar. My son ordered the patron frozen margarita and rates it 10/10.  We also ordered salmon bites and I rated it 4/10 due to over seasoned and salty.  The total bill for three people - $274 to include a mandatory 20% Service Fee.  Ambiance - beautiful.  Food - moderate to high depending your taste buds. Cost - $$$$.\",\n",

The place was pretty empty so my table should've been ready when I checked in 5 mins prior. She walked us to the table and says, your 2 hours start now. She never greeted us, welcomed us, nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nWaitress Zee comes to our table with a smile on her face, she welcomed us, and showed us how to access the menu from the QR code. Zee told us all about the menu, what were the popular items, her favorites, the drinks, etc. I was impressed with her knowledge and professionalism.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe ordered the K&K omelet, traditional waffles, specialty waffles (they never made it to the table), the mimosa tower, appetizers, and much more.  Every food item was delicious!!! The mimosa tower was perfect for our table and the drinks in the tequila bottles were too cute.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bill comes and here are the issues. The menu states a side of traditional waffles are $13, well they charged $17. I pointed this out to Zee and she said, there's nothing she can do because they can't change what the system automatically generates. I call BS, but they weren't willing to make the change. There is a 20% service charge so pay attention to your bill.\\r\\n\\r\\nHonestly,  I will probably go back because the food was good but slightly over priced.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh lastly, the women's bathroom only had one working toilet.

All of the sides are a la carte but are small portioned. I ordered the Jerk chicken, which was nicely flavored, and a side of yams but I do not believe it was worth $11 except the fact that my side was bigger than my portion of chicken. My friend ordered shrimp and grits with a side of the shrimp deviled eggs and somehow the order was incorrect but was quickly fixed by our waitress Christy (who was amazing) but I hate sending food back and wasting it being a previous waitress myself. The drinks were really good and although the food took a while to come out despite it being not crowded just yet and most of the table already had food, it was good! Overall it was a decent experience and the food was great! I guess I was hoping overall 3rd time would be a charm but it was good.'}\n",

We did as told and waited downstairs. 45 minutes passed and we still had not been seated. I went to the hostess to inquire if our table was ready and I was told “we came looking for you but couldn’t find you so we gave your table away.” I found it to be impossible that they came looking for a group of 12 people waiting downstairs. I never got a text notification or open table notification stating my table was ready, and no one came down looking for us.

But this really takes away from the ability to have a relaxing meal and conversation with such wonderful food.  Our ears were ringing when we left because the music was sooo loud.  It is suggested that perhaps the tables can be spaced out better and while that may result in a few less tables on the floor, the customers may be happier.

Also the manager on duty that night, Moo, came over to check on us. He shared with us that they were actually a bit understaffed, as they don't typically get busy crowds on Monday evenings. We observed Moo assisting the waiters by serving food, making drinks behind the bar, all this on top of his normal managerial duties. We thought that was very telling of his exceptional character, as his efforts truly reflect the core standards of excellence that KK upholds. Great work, Moo and Tarik!\\n\\nAgain, 10/10! My fiance and I are already planning to make this a monthly tradition. If you are reading this, THIS is your sign to have your next dinner, event, or happy hour at Kitchen + Kocktails!! You will not be disappointed.\"}\n",

It is also ecstatically cute for pics.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the service was not good likely due to how busy it was.  Our waitress was really nice, but it troubles me to share that we ordered three appetizers that never made its way to our table.  We also asked for condiments that we did not get until our food was almost finished.  Note, the food was good.  I am happy to share K+K attempted to rectify the situation by taking 10% off each meal.\\n\\nLastly, I had to return the bill to be corrected, and to make matters worse, we were charged a whopping $42 SERVICE CHARGE (20%)… .   There was even a prompt for a TIP!  Bless there hearts… .☺️\\n\\nTo the owner(s) of the restaurant, I recommend lessening or eliminating the 20% service charge and make our young folks “EARN” their work through a genuine demonstration of QUALITY service.  Adding a 20% service charge to the bill is unfair to your customers who received subpar service.  It also lessens the pressure for our young folks to always perform at a high standard when they know there is service  money to be shared at the end of the day.\",\n",

      "    \"review_text\": \"We are from Seattle but visit DC often. This was the worst DC dining experience ever and I have had several hundred. Initially, they did not have enough chairs for our party of 7.  When the appetizers came there were no plates and missing silverware. The server said the restaurant did not have enough plates, so we'd have to share plates. When we choose to share sides and did not order individual sides for each person, the server seemed irritated and borderline rude.  (Some of the sides came out 20 minutes before the entrees.)  The irony is even though service was bad (the server never checked on us), she told us if we tipped, she'd get the entire tip.

I wasn't fond on where we sat, which was in a side room, near the back bar, which felt like we were isolated from the rest of the restaurant and didn't enjoy the ambiance. The rose flower walls were cute for pics. On the way out to our car, we peeked at the lower level, which seem fun with the DJ and lounge setting. Valet was good. However, they ran out of take-out bags for the excess food we took home. It was weird to have to carry our boxes in hand. Overall, cute and will back again to sit in a different area.\",\n",

Cons: I was not acknowledged by a wait staff member until 35+ minutes after being seated (not even offered water), the waitress was clearly overworked and had an attitude, the bathroom was filthy and didn’t have any hand soap, there is a mandatory 20% gratuity charge and the service was nowhere near justifying that amount, the party next to me waited an hour for their food which was brought out cold; this very polite and friendly coupled was pushed to the point of demanding a full refund and leaving hungry.

The music and crowd were not too loud and people were dressed decent casual to slightly dressy. I parked on the street in front of the restaurant, which appeared to be mostly two hour parking and valet. Service was really nice/helpful but really slow. It took about 40 minutes after ordering to get our entrées. The people next to us sat 15 to 20 minutes before being greeted. My friends and I had salmon bites, chicken and waffles, and the catfish breakfast. Food was ok, not great. I’ve had much better brunch food at basic less expensive restaurants. It felt like our entrees were missing a sauce or topping or something that would have elevated the dishes. The drinks were definitely the highlight. We had the frozen margaritas and peach D’usse.. I’d give both an 8/10. Decor/ambiance was cute but gave that eerie nightclub during the day vibe due to the black walls and recessed lighting. I read in another review that this location used to be Toro Toro.. yes it definitely is the same place. We spent $100 each with gratuity. Overall I’d recommend K+K for drinks, and I’m guessing dinner is more impressive than brunch.\",\n",

The food was only slightly warm, pickles were way too salty and the grits had zero flavor. They did have a limited selection of wines but nothing by the glass and the bottles were extremely overpriced (having worked in the wine business). Average was $200-$400 for wines you can buy in the store for under $20. I will try the Dallas location next time. May just be the DC location that was lacking.

Those were the best waffles I have ever had, I’m not exaggerating. The chef also brought out another flavor of waffles from the menu for me to try, and they were also delicious. Drinks were pretty and tasted good, but on the expensive side. Pricing is a bit high. On my check there was the chicken & waffles, 1 margarita and a bottled water. The total was $80.

The meals are a bit pricey and they did not disclose the price of the tower before purchasing so the the price was a shock when the bill arrived. That would be my only complaint.

The bites were over cooked, salty and the temperature was not warm so those weren’t my favorite. We didn’t place our order for our entrees until about 20 minutes after we finished our appetizers. It took about 45 minutes to an hour for our meals to come out, and our waitress let us know the kitchen was behind. We both ordered chicken and waffles. My niece ordered the specialty waffles which were smothered in peaches. She ate the peaches, however the waffles were extremely soggy to the point she didn’t really eat them. The chicken was tasty. We ordered white meat and were given a breast and a leg. The skin is good but if you want more meat than skin then you probably shouldn’t order the white meat.

The hostess greeted us warmly and we were seated. My waitress was great. Now, let's get to the food. We started with the fried green tomatoes and the devil eggs, which were great. It was very tasty. I ordered the lobster and waffles, and my cousin ordered the pork chop breakfast. My dish was definitely overpriced. I was expecting a larger lobster tail for the price of $50! The tail was very small and quite disappointing. My cousin's fried porkchop tasted rancid, and the breading left much to be desired. A glass of lemonade was $9!! I wanted a glass of wine with my meal, but they don't sell wine by the glass. You have to buy a bottle, which I wasn't doing since I was the only one drinking. Overall, I was quite disappointed in the overpriced food.\",\n",

        "review_text": "Not a good experience. This was my third time at Aurum and both times previous were a great experiences. However, this time it was different. For starters, we were seated in the back where a large party of people were also seated. Which is fine, but the noise level was at 8/10. Yelling over each other instead of speaking at a respectful level with the understanding that others are trying to enjoy their dinners as well. While this was going on, I enjoyed a really well made pasta dish. A sacchetti with acorn squash. Which was the highlight of the night. But then, a bachelorette party arrived. Bringing the noise to a 10/10 and utterly unbearable. As we already ordered, our ceasar salad arrived and we attempted to enjoy it. Unfortunately the salad was lacking any type of zest or garlic, the main ingredient in a ceasar. At this point the noise was so intense that another table had to be moved into the other room. Seeing our unhappy faces, our waiter took the initiative to set another table for us as well. So we moved and happily tried to enjoy the rest of our meal. We had the Trout and the Trumpet mushrooms with Soba noodles as our main. The comedy / tragedy of the situation was now that both meals were too heavily salted. To the point they were completely inedible. Now I love salt and tried to enjoy the meal as much as I could but this was extreme. On top of that. As we felt the cool breeze through the restaurant due to the door being left open. A nice feeling to be sure. Someone was again so discourteous as to smoke a cigar not 2 feet from the open door! I enjoy a cigarette every once in awhile but I know I didn’t order one with my dinner. To me, both issues of the noise and the cigar are issues that management should have rectified. To their credit, management did apologize and tried to make it right. But the damage was already done. Not sure I’ll ever return."

Our reservation was for 7:15 but we waited at least 30 minutes before the table was ready. The dining room was basic and loud. We ordered a very nice bottle of wine from the reserve wine list, but the server brought the wrong one and was about to serve it without mentioning it was a different bottle. Apparently they were out of the one we ordered so she went back to find a different one. The salad was served before she came back with the wine. Finally she served the wine (after struggling with the cork). Entrees were very pricey for what they were, mainly $50-$60 per person. The duck was good but the trout was over seasoned and salty. We ordered the “Fat Elvis” for dessert hoping to redeem the evening with a fun decadent treat, but we got a small, stale muffin, a tiny scoop of peanut butter mousse, and a lot of cold chopped bacon which could have been from the morning. Overall not worth the hype or the price! Better options in Breckenridge and Summit County."

The wedge salad was the best bleu cheese dressing I've ever had and the burger and fries were both very good and filling. The Korean fried chicken pieces could've been a little crisper and spicier, but were delicious nonetheless--we ate every bite of all of the dishes. I also had a delicious shrub cocktail w/bourbon and a class of Sangiovese. We didn't have room for dessert, but did have a couple amari that were delicious. We've already picked what we want to try from the rest of the menu when we return."

Our server, Bryan, was friendly, attentive, and explained the food in detail. We ordered many dishes to share, and we were impressed with the speed the plates came out of the kitchen and the efficiency of the staff to handle all of the food. \n\nWe started with four different cocktails that were all delicious, but the Spicy Cucumber Margaritas were the table favorite. The Mountain Time was refreshing if you like gin, the Ginger Pear Martini was on the sweet side, and the Smokey Alpine Glow was fantastic if you like Mezcal tequila. It is pretty smokey if that is your thing (it is mine).\n\nSince we were with our adult children who are adventurous eaters, we shared all of the dishes. We ordered 9 dishes and that was the perfect amount of food as there was nothing left over and everyone was pleasantly satiated. Here is what we thought:\n\nParker House Rolls - pretty typical and nothing outstanding\nCrispy Curried Cauliflower - if you like a bit of curry, this dish is fantastic!\nKorean BBQ Pork Ribs - A-maz-ing! Everyone loved the sauce and they were so tender.                                              \nMiso Asparagus Bisque - very well balanced. We ordered two bowls and we all really wanted just a little bit more. Note: if you are taking pictures for a review, this dish is a not well photographed. The bowl is presented with asparagus and pistachio dust and then the servers pour in the soup and it becomes a bowl of greatness that looks bad in pics. \nHamachi Crudo - a very well balanced, typical (in a great way) version of crudo. The Hamachi was fresh and perfectly sliced. We had two of these for the table.\nHousemade  Rotating Pasta - It was good, but we didn't get the notes that Bryan said we would taste. It was very unique. This dish changes all the time, so what I say doesn't really matter here:) \nFarmers Market Special -"

I recommend skipping an appetizer or splitting the burgers. The second night we each had a salad - one the Market salad and one the Wedge. I had the Korean ribs and my husband had the Korean chicken. I prefer the chicken but both were delicious and not too much although I shared the ribs. The tasting menu is great too if you want a larger meal."

The only criticism I have, we ordered more butter for the rolls, which our server was happy to do. However when I was still eating my salad, the server asked my husband if he was finished with his salad. Proper etiquette is servers should wait until everyone has finished their particular course before clearing any dishes. 1, it made me feel rushed and as if I didn’t matter. 2, HE TOOK ALL THE BUTTER AS WELL and I still had my roll I wanted to finish with my salad!  The entrees were very good! Next time I guess I’ll guard the extra butter with my life!😕"

We could not hear ourselves think at our little table for two jammed between the wall and this mega-party. We noticed others in our situation having the same problem. While we enjoy the food at Aurum, it felt like a wasted evening because we could not even talk to each other over the boisterous dinner party. The party looked like fun, if you were in it, but for the rest of us, we should have found somewhere else to go. I feel like the restaurant should let you know if they are seating you in a group like this so you can opt in or out. We would have gone elsewhere that evening - no hard feelings. But I do kind of have hard feelings since this was an important dinner out for us and a lost opportunity to enjoy some ambience. We were vacationing and we don't get to go here often, but this will be my lasting impression, sadly."

We assumed that the “half price appetizers” would be diminished portions, as is the case at many other restaurants; this was not the case. We took home half the food we had ordered, graciously packed up by our server. Aurum fully deserves its reputation as best happy hour in Breckenridge."

First of all, we experienced terrible traffic, leaving Denver, and were running about an hour late. The staff was more than accommodating for this untimely arrival. The steak, however, was extremely chewy and all the dishes, including my salad, and both soups, were excessively salty.  After dinner, we were thirsty all night, and my date suffered from G.I. distress. I woke up this morning still pondering how different from the first experience, this was"

Great staff, nice decor, appropriate noise level and the food was absolutely fantastic.  I wish I had taken photos because the presentation alone was worthy.  \n\nWe passed on the tasting menu choosing instead, a la carte.  Started with the crispy cauliflower.  I'm not a cauliflower fan but, much like Brussel sprouts, when prepared in great flavors, truly enjoyable.  The portion size was large and it could have had a bit more flavor/spice (and slightly smaller pieces) allowing for more flavor per bite, which is my preference.  If you love cauliflower however, this one's for you.\n\nMain courses were really good.  Wife loved her 10oz Marinated Coulotte Steak.  Tender, flavorful and prepared perfectly served with pureed potatoes.  I chose the Grilled Achiote Chicken and it was absolutely fantastic.  Great presentation, huge portion, excellently seasoned with just a little heat and incredibly juicy!  One of the best preparations of a 1/2 chicken I've ever had.  The chili cheddar polenta was a perfect, slightly crispy accompaniment.  \n\nFinally, having seen them on the table next to us, we gave in and ordered the chocolate chip cookies for dessert.  4 cookies, freshly baked, lightly salted... along with a generous scoop of chocolate chip cookie dough was the perfect finale.  \n\nI highly recommend Aurum and will be back soon!"

We were celebrating my husband’s birthday and usually they will give you a complimentary glass of champagne or bithday dessert when you are celebrating a special occasion.  We did not get the champagne, which is okay and then they charged us for the birthday dessert.  None of those are the ones that cause my lowered rating though.  The reason why we were not happy this time is mostly because of our server.  He took forever to get back to us and we ended up serving the wine ourselves as he never even tried.  Service was slow. Regarding the food, we both ordered the NY Strip and my husband received a steak mostly fat.  He was able to eat just some of it.  It was really disappointing.  I have to say that all our previous experiences were awesome.  This time was not.  I will give them another try but if this continues most probably we won’t go back or recommend.

Marginal at best.  Others that had the scallops said they were just OK, slightly over cooked and not that fresh.  As a local there some really good restaurants in Summit County, so i hope that mgt and the chef improve the food quality and presentation!"

There were only 2 tables occupied in the room we were shown and the hostess wanted to seat us right next to one of the occupied tables.  We asked to be moved - she made excuses but finally found another table.  We didn't see the waiter for some time and when he did stop by it was only to say he would be back.  5-10 minutes later he returned and told us the specials without having first taken our drink orders.  When he finished his spiel we ordered a bottle of wine, a beer and a basket of bread.  The beer came later, followed by the wine even later.  The bread did not come until our entrees though we asked repeatedly.  The salads arrived eventually - they were satisfacgtory.  I ordered the duck which must have been infused with salt as it was very salty throughout (and I love salt).  The trout was dry and when the bread arrived it was dry as well.  We didn't eat it.  Overall an extremely disappointing experience.  We would not recommend it."

What I received was full of tendons, fat, and incredibly undercooked. I tried my best to choke it down as I was with some clients but ended up passing on most of it. In retrospect, I should have just sent it back.\n\nThe server did address this and agreed with me that it was rare and he did speak to the chef. One of my clients did also try it and I won't share his precise words - but he did agree with me that it was below par. \n\nOur server did comp the deserts which were fine - but overall, for the price tag and expectations - the experience left much to be desired. The drinks were good and the wine pairing suggestion was solid. My clients had a better experience and at the end of the day, that was the most important part of the evening.

They had a table reserved with a card signed by the staff wishing us a Happy anniversary, and served us two glasses of Prosecco . The service was great and the food was out of the this world. The flavor combinations were well put together.  They served us their a complementary dessert, version of Milk and Cookies was the perfect ending to a great meal."

I should have asked. I’m not price sensitive but dislike feeling ripped off."

I had the trout which was delicious and served with grilled squash and cilantro risotto. It really was servings for 2; I couldn’t finish it and I was stuffed. My partner had a beef special that was served w/ grilled veggies and mashed potatoes- also delicious. He was stuffed as well. No room for dessert so we had coffee and it was fine. Fabulous menu and staff. We would dine here again on our next visit."

No idea how Google rating is 4.7 with over 500 reviews. Salmon tartare was really lox and very little of it. Butternut squash fritters were solid dough and you had to work hard to find the squash flavor especially with the overpowering tomatoe pure. The baguette was served with a steak knife. They knew how hard it was. It was also stone cold and the cheese stuff inside did nothing to exhannce the dish. Even the salad with it was impossible to finish as the bitterness of the ridiccio overpowered everything else. So we decided to share the French onion burger to be safe and even that was bad. Buns were burnt. It had crazy flavor that overpowered the burger yet there was nothing on the bun or burger to scrape off and try to make it edible. The wine and server were both great but would never go back."

Pretty inedible and tasted fishy meaning the trout needed to be thrown out a couple of days prior.\nWe ate about three bites each. Server never asked if we liked it when he could clearly see food was untouched.\nIt will be some time before I go back for a high priced experience of bad food no matter how spectacular the ambiance."

I was a little upset because it was great but we were leaving the next day and we were not going to be able to go back again until we return to the area. We are back and this is the first restaurant we visited.  Then and now the food is excellent, delicious!  Service is amazing.  One of our favorite restaurants in Breckenridge.  Definitely will recommend to family and friends."

We asked if the Caesar salad would pair well with the Baked  Baguette dish (really a salad) and the Zucchini Cappelini. The Caesar was good, but not grea.  The Zucchini dish was very good and not overcooked.  The Baked Baguette didn't pair well with the Caesar and was only fair.  Our waiter likely could have put some thought into it and made better suggestions. We've found several amazing restaurants in Breckenridge, but this one either had a bad night or is trading on the captive out of town folks. Too many other great, or very good, choices in the area to go back."

I walked in 3 days before the reservation to confirm and saw we were allocated a high top table in the bar area. The day of our reservation, however, there was a different group already seated at the table I was shown was going to be for us, and we were put in a booth (not desirable for us) in the back of the restaurant. The back area has more of a restaurant/cafe vibe than happy hour, bar vibe. It is quieter in the back if you have anyone \"hard of hearing\" but for our group, the ambience wasn't what we'd booked. The did enjoy the food and found the happy hour food specials to be a good value ($5-$16.) But a HH chardonnay was $19...not a great value. To be fair, Aurum does have some $9-12 dollar wines, $9 cocktails, and $5-7 beers."

It was a very blend taste. And I requested a birthday cake for my bf, they brought it with no energy, and just put it on the table and said here just a special desert for the birthday person and left. for a $600 experience, it wasn’t worth at all.

Our waiter was attentive and the food and drink all came out promptly.  The crispy cauliflower was A+, the squash fritters were OK, a little bland. The house special pasta was excellent as was the baguette with goat cheese.  Here is where it turns, the waiters are hard upselling major items like \" waygu steak for $115 would be great to share\" or \" you can add a leg to your duck breast for an additional $40\".  The $8 bread and butter was not a pleasant surprise.  When the check arrived there was an additional charge tagged as \" kitchen appreciation\"   I asked the waiter and he said \" its to ensure our kitchen staff dont quit\".   I paid the check, left a 20% tip for the waiter but it struck me as odd that instead of the owner paying his kitchen staff a decent wage, he passes that responsibility on to his customers.\nIn the end it all seemed a bit shady and we left feeling like we just bought a used car.  Wont be returning."

Our server James and an occasional appearance by the General Manager Grayson made us feel like we were the only ones in the restaurant. Amazing job to all! Highly recommended on a fronts."

We often start the night with a high end NA cocktail if the list is sophisticated enough and then go to wine bottles for dinner. We prefer the entire experience but less alcohol after the entire meal."

Aurum is known for its happy hour which we enjoyed with the rolls and Caesar, both great. We ordered the strip steak and the duck confit. \n\nThe manager brought our meals. The steak looked rare (my son ordered medium rare) and my confit looked strange. My son refused to return the steak. As for my meal, the sauce that went with it was quite spicy, so I didn’t get the suspicion that this confit might have come from the night before until I’d already eaten half of the duck. The red flag was that our meals came so soon after we’d ordered. I later found out that there was a wedding party of 30, so I wondered if they just threw our meal slapdash.\n\nWe ordered their chocolate chip cookie dessert, which was amazing. Absolutely no sign Aurum read my reservation that it was a birthday dinner.\n\nWould we return? I don’t know."

I am not a gratis fans but she made me taste them, wow. They were different from any grits I have tried, excellent. I ordered the Duck Leg Confit, seriously the best I ever had. The meat was melt in your mouth tender. Our waitress was exceptional and extremely knowledgeable of the menu. As you can see there was a large loud table next to us, giving the noise level a 2."

Not one of our 4 dishes was good.  One dish was a corn fritter with a mole sauce.  We asked for some more sauce as there wasn't enough ( in our opinion and another customer).  After waiting a long time, it came out cold (like straight out of the fridge).  And they charged .75 for it!  Our server was friendly, pleasant, but service was very slow.   Just a very disappointing and expensive experience."

The bar tender was a magic man, his drinks were balance and complex. The half price appetizers were delicious and generous, I highly recommend the curried cauliflower. \nOnce we were seated at the table, the delights kept coming. My husband has a gluten and dairy allergy. There were plenty of options on the menu he could choose from and the staff was knowledgeable and sensitive to his needs. \n Overall, everything we ate and drank was amazing and the service was great, The staff was friendly, attentive and knowledgeable. As foodies and adventurous eaters we thoroughly enjoyed our experience. Thanks for helping make our anniversary a great one."

We’re we’re given a complimentary glass of Prosecco for our 35th anniversary that was so good I ordered a glass with dinner. From the first order of the crispy curried cauliflower to the last order of the double chocolate dessert  every dish was exquisite. The cauliflower was perfectly balanced nothing overdone nor understated and deliciously seasoned with a hazelnut dukkah. For the main entree I had the duck breast cooked to perfection as James asked to what temperature I wanted the duck cooked. I asked for 150 degrees a medium rare and that’s what I got. The accompanying veggies were cooked to perfection and served with glass noodles. The flavors of all the sauces and dishes were 10 of 10. I will definitely come back and recommend this restaurant to any foodie."

Make a reservation...I have been turned away before because there were no seats left at 4:30.  We had the cauliflower which was yummy.  We each had the burger & fries which is a lot of food if you also get an appetizer.  We also got the falafel but had to take it to go because we had already had generous amounts of food.  The burger was good, the falafel nice but we eat a lot of Mediterranean food as local places so we like just a basic falafel...this one was elevated, for sure.  The hostess was very nice and she made me feel appreciated for making the reservation...'we have YOUR table right here\".  Our waiter was also very good.  Oh, and I had a cocktail on the HH menu called the John Daly and it was lemony and delicious.  I heard the person at the next table say he really liked the mule."

We went for dinner one evening and our server told us about their great happy hour so we went back for that. On both visits we thoroughly enjoyed the creative cuisine and terrific wines and cocktails. We looked forward to returning but the pandemic restrictions prevented that for too long.  We were excited that Aurum came through the pandemic seemingly better than we had remembered.  We secured an early reservation - a must even on a weeknight. We took advantage of happy hour specials - savings on select wines and half price small plates. We shared a Crispy Cauliflower snack an unique preparation - absolutely delicious. We ordered the large plate Rocky Mountain trout which came with amazing accoutrements of English pea risotto, pickled asparagus and parmesan crisp. All portions are generous and great for couples to share. We finished with a double chocolate cherry mousse. We highly recommend Aurum - it is an exceptional restaurant experience."

There are 15 spots at the bar and long table that are first come first serve but apparently a line forms 1 hour prior to opening. Food was unique and delicious. The only food item we didn’t like was the pork belly. The flavor was very bland and all items didn’t taste well together. The Korean fried chicken wasn’t very Korean style. Too much sauce and the chicken seemed more like fried batter. Other than that the service was impeccable and ambience was nice. Highly recommend!

Loved all - maybe a bit less enthusiastic with the chicken.  This is definitely upscale apps and creative cooking.  I took away a star because of the brusque rudeness of a manager that seated me (I think he said he was in from Steamboat so maybe not a regular) and then the dirty looks he gave us near the end of our stay obviously urging us to leave.  I would prefer an honest conversation about how it was a busy time for them… etc.  Our server, John, was pleasant and fine.  I would definitely go again.

The servers who took care of us were friendly, efficient, and fun to interact with.\n\nIt was a busy night and to say the noise level was \"energetic\" makes me smile.  There was a large party at the table behind us who were simply drunk and very loud.  It was quite entertaining, but it made conversing difficult.  It appeared that even the servers were having a difficult time conversing with the customers.\n\nI love coming here and certainly will return on my next trip to Breckenridge."

Other food options reasonably priced as well.  Everything we had was very well prepared and flavorful - it is obvious the kitchen takes pride in their work.  Great atmosphere and well executed team service.\n\nNote - while Aurum has a lively bar scene, it is a somewhat smaller space, so while this is a best Happy Hour from a value and quality perspective I wouldn't roll in here looking for a big après ski party atmosphere, or without a reservation."

Then the food.  Yes. I mean the quinoa stew and pork belly were just sinfully delicious and wedge salad seemed basic but the butter lettuce elevated it a little. The mahi-mahi was Asian inspired and each bite was a party in my mouth. Tried the “cheese cake” dessert w churros and man, I wished I ordered 2!.  My son loved the mango sorbet.

It is evident that the staff is hard working and want your experience to be a good one. We recommend Aurum wholeheartedly."

The wine selection was good, the Dr. Jones cocktail was very well made; highly recommended.\nWe shared a few plates, the Korean fried chicken and pork belly were incredible. Get it. You won’t be disappointed. The pork belly was so juicy and tender, the Korean fried chicken was crispy and perfectly sauced, juicy chicken bites.\nWe shared the duck special for our main, it was cooked and seasoned perfectly. Our only gripe was the price, but even at that price point, it was worth it.\nWe will be back again next time we are in Breck."

Our server was not well coached to work at this restaurant, nor give us the confidence that he actually knew the food or drinks available.  Starters and appetizers (a bit confusing on the menu) were not overwhelming.  We ordered three plates for our party of four.  The Crudo fish plate only had 3 servings.  At the very least the server should have made us aware and offered to add a fourth serving at additional cost.  The crispy curried cauliflower was definitely a hit.  The mains were okay, but by no means were they great,  A bit insulting to be charged $6 for four small dinner rolls which arrived late as the server forgot to submit to the kitchen.  Lastly there is a 3% surcharge which allegedly goes to the back room (kitchen).  Really?........why not just raise your already overpriced foods."

The menu offers varied, interesting, and tasty dishes, balancing some traditional fare with more innovative dishes. Each day, the chef offers a different pasta dish, all of which sound wonderful.  I chose a blend of Asian-inspired dishes like the Korean Fried Chicken (by the way, super-delicious), and balanced that with a harvest season salad of arugula, almonds, pears, and burrata.  I topped it off with a delicious chablis, and ended with the chocolate gelato. Overall, a superb meal in the Colorado mountains that also offers excellent service. I highly recommend Aurum."

We had the Corn \"Ribs,\" the Hamachi, and Pear and Arugula salad for appetizers and then shared the Braised Chicken Plate as our main course.  Everything was seasoned and presented with perfection Our young server was helpful with wine pairings and made suggestions for wines that we have never tried before--all were outstanding and excellent choices for the cuisine. The ambience was lovely and the service in general was top notch! For example, being from California we booked an  table outside but the weather suddenly turned cold by California standards. The Aurum staff had the foresight to save us a romantic table inside--just in case--so we were seated there at once. I have led many Art/Food/Wine tours internationally as a museum professional and culinary enthusiast and Aurum is right up there with the very best!  Can't wait to return when we are in Colorado again. Thank you Aurum for a great Anniversary celebration including the delicious complimentary champagne for our anniversary toast!"

We also ordered an extra crabcake for $8 - it was about the tiniest crabcake I've ever seen - possibly 1.5 tablespoons of crab.....  Tasted ok but not a good value for the price. \n\nManagement was generous and removed the bland main course from our bill which was VERY nice!\n\nBTW - their Aurum Manhattan was worth the $15! The addition of chartreuse gave an understated herbal note to the drink which was a great taste3!"

It took a long time for her to even say hello and get our drink order, which were good once we finally got them.  I had asked for a high top on my open table reservation and didn't get it.  We placed our dinner order and she must have forgotten to turn the order into the kitchen.  She apologized and said the \"system\" had some glitches but our order would be right out and she would appreciate our patience, we were fine with waiting as we had ordered some $6 rolls which she did replenish free of charge after I asked for more.  People sat after us were already eating.  She asked if we had been brought our food (there was no food on our table)?  Food finally came but wasn't cooked as requested (medium) for the Manhattan steak...my friend ate it anyhow because we waited so long.  I informed the waitress that the steak was undercooked but she blamed it on her handwriting saying the chef probably couldn't read it.  Over all I wouldn't go back unless it is 1/2 price happy hour because the prices aren't worth the experience especially if you have an inattentive/unapologetic waitress.  They need more vegetarian options on the menu as well."

Food was good, the Bass was only ok.  Cocktails and moctails were great.  Our dessert was sent to another table where it sat for 5 minutes and then given to us.  The guy at that table shopped it around stating it wasn’t his.  They were billed for it too.  Value is low in my opinion, my son and my bill totaled $225.  Way better value in Breckenridge.

We highly recommend this restaurant. Reservations are a must for the Happy Hour as it is very popular.  The only downside is the noise level in the dining room. As the room filled, it became extremely noisy, especially when a party of ten women were seated. My waiter had difficulty hearing me and my husband and I periodically couldn’t talk to each other.

For our main entree we split the sea bass served with risotto and green beans and a red vermouth reduction sauce . The chef knows how to deliver the sauce - oh my - so very good .  Not that we had to have dessert but we did . James suggested a honey cake with some peaches and cherries . I think I will go for a chocolate dessert next time .

One of our best meals in Breckenridge, but the service made our experience even better. Thanks Aurum and James!"

We were very excited to dine here based upon reviews.  We have been dining in Breckenridge for over 35 years and love when new restaurants come to town.  Although they have been open since 2018, with the pandemic, we didn't have an opportunity to visit until now.  To be honest, we were underwhelmed over all.  Our starters were the crispy curried cauliflower and the Aurum caesar.  We loved  the cauliflower and 5-stars!  A wonderful blend of flavors and crispy to perfection.  Finally a restaurant that serves \"real\" caesar salad with anchovies and disappointed to have only 2 anchovies.  For dinner, we ordered the Korean Fried Chicken, French Onion Burger and Half Chicken Duo.  The Korean Fried Chicken was very tasty but not as \"hot\" as advertised.  As for the French Onion Burger, it was very good but paid $27 for burger and fries because they were out of our original order of Grilled Octopus.  The Half Chicken Duo had a beautiful presentation!!  A hearty serving and many different flavors but lacked that last finishing flavor that would send it over the top.  Great service from Thomas!!  Overall, a bit pricey even for resort standards and compared to many of the other fine-dining restaurants we frequent in Breckenridge."

That was not the case at all. We arrived a little early but were seated immediately. The host was incredibly gracious and personable; we all wanted to marry him. Our server was Francesca (I apologize if I slaughtered the spelling) and she was a delight. She recommended things (aka the Pinot Noir that was absolutely killer) when we got stuck, sold the dishes so well, and was a comfortable level of casual while keeping things professional without being stuffy. There were about 4-5 people either picking up plates, replenishing water, taking pictures for us, dropping off food, opening windows....you name it, they did it. And might I add that everyone was so heckin’ pleasant and great? Because they were and it elevated the experience. The food could have been only subpar and I would have come back there in a heartbeat. Luckily the food was absolutely killer. Everything from the rolls to the asparagus soup to the hangar steak....there was not one single bad bite of food the whole night. \nFrom what started out as a rough day due to a power outage while on vacation turned into something we will remember for the rest of our lives. We were so happy we made the reservations because that trip to Aurum made our trip so much more incredible.\nThank you to everyone at Aurum for embodying what great hospitality is."

Trust me. \n\nThe only reason I couldn’t give five stars for service is that we waited nearly 20 minutes after being seated before being able to place our drink and app order. Granted, it was during a very busy happy hour, but it also seemed like there may have been a miscommunication about who would work our table. The dining experience was well worth the initial wait.

I thought the market pasta would be vegetarian at least, but it wasn’t. I ended up cobbling a meal together from appetizers. The asparagus soup was good but barely warm. The falafels were fine but very bland to make a meal out of. The one bright spot was the strawberry and burrata salad, which was awesome. As for others in my party, the trout was apparently over cooked and over salted. The Asian noodles in the chicken and Asian noodles dish were quite spicy and undercooked. They were hard to chew. Overall, feels like a wasted dinner in Breckenridge. No issues with service or ambiance."

We could only get a 5:15pm reservation as everything late was booked 2.5 weeks out already. We got there and the waiter mentioned happy hour food selections were half off. So, WE WENT NUTS!!! We ordered so much for our stomachs HURT at the end of the meal. Then the check came. The prior 2 nights we are good meals at nice restaurants that we about $400 for the 4 of us before tip. I completely expected our tab at Arum to be around $400 as well--AND WOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPY TO PAY IT!!! Because the food is that good. Our bill? $211....OMFG. I was shocked!!! What a value.

Our biggest disappointment was the service: our waiter was overly-emotive and inattentive. We understand Covid has changed things up, but when he walked past our table several times without checking in or even making eye contact, we were at a loss. When I eventually received the nice glass of wine I had ordered with dinner (it came half way through, by the way), he never came back to check on us. The wine was 'corked' (I think I've returned wine only twice before). Eventually we caught the attention of another staff member who immediately brought over some options (of course, I chose a different wine). Literally within 2 minutes, our original server came over to remove all alcohol from the table (county restrictions). We asked if he could clear the other tables first and then come on back as I had just gotten this $16 glass of vino. \"No\" was his response! So, bottoms-up: what a waste! Then he mentioned a \"birthday dessert\" for our daughter. With hesitancy, we choose the creme brûlée with 3 spoons. Soon the check was presented: wine, dessert all included. What a shame - I will never go back and certainly not recommend Aurum when there are so many other lovely customer-friendly restaurants in Breckenridge. \nPS. In all the Open Table reviews I've made (hundreds), this is probably the 2nd bad review I've ever given. Sorry, but true."

For dinner I had the Rocky Mountain Trout (which was amazing) and my friends tried the Hanger Steak, Prime Tenderloin, and Duck Breast (all gave raving reviews about each). And last but certainly not least we indulged in 2 of the dessert items the Smoked White Chocolate Creme Brûlée and the Warm Milk and Cookies. Wooowwww both were so enjoyable but I think we all agreed our favorite part of the whole meal was the Warm Milk and Cookies! If you are considering Aurum on a night out for dinner I highly recommend and seriously cannot say enough good things about the food and service!"

My friend ordered the trout and she was pleased with its freshness. The accompanying pea risotto was different and exciting. I got butternut squash soup and a salad and they both likewise were fabulous. The soup was fresh and offered three varied styles of apple, but could have been a little thicker and richer. All in all, it was an amazing evening."

While being out side was great....as we were eating the staff was starting to close down the patio....putting up chairs, turning lights off, moving tables in side.  We ended up feeling pretty much like they were ready for us to leave.  The food was good, but my suggestion is wait till your guests are done dining until closing shop, we felt like they were in a hurry to get the heck out of there.  Not good when you spend the $$ we did and sat on a lovely patio.  The 15 minutes it would have taken after we left would have been well spent."

Fast and friendly service, but a couple small mix-ups with dishes, which they happily fixed. Ordering mostly from the happy hour menu made the prices reasonable for our family of 5.  Our favorites were the curried cauliflower (this was amazing!!), Korean fried chicken, and elote corn ribs.  Beef tartare was very good; felt like we could have skipped the hamachi crudo (it was tasty but have had better at Japanese restaurants). Cocktails were tasty. Even kids' meals were substantial and yummy, too (one got cheeseburger, which was very large for a kid, and the other got seared trout which was cooked nicely).  We will definitely return!"

We sat inside because it was a bit chilly and we loved the chic ambience...especially the beautiful bar area.  Our appetizers (Hamachi Crudo and Prime Tartar) were 5 star as were our cocktails.  My husband’s filet was a 5-star perfectly cooked meal, but my entree (the curry Halibut) must have sat under the light because it was overcooked and dry...and too heavy on the fish sauce...so disappointing after the strong start.  I ordered curried cauliflower with my meal but it got missed.  Our waiter still brought it with a big apology and comped it because we were mostly done.  Service started out strong and then weakened greatly after the appetizer.  A lot of time passed between apps and dinner.  Not sure what happened because all started so good.  We left satisfied and would definitely come back for happy hour and dinner again."

He makes everyone feel like they are the most important client in the room.  Throughout the meal, cocktails were perfectly concocted.  Most importantly the food was out of this world.  Everybody ordered the Hangar steak which is well proportioned, melt in your mouth goodness.   Thanks Aurum for a great birthday experience."

The others in my group said their meals were okay only which was a disappointment. I thought it odd that the busboy did not ask how our food was when 2 plates went back half eaten-he never even asked if we wanted to take the food home."

We didn’t even consider sending either back since we were starving at that point.  \n\nOur server and the manager both apologized and didn’t charge us for my wife’s steak or 2 glasses of wine, so we were satisfied with their response.

Let’s begin with the positives.  The restaurant creates a nice vibe with contemporary décor that works well with mountain décor.  The menu has many interesting options. The Parker Rolls with house-made honey butter were a great start to the meal. The cauliflower appetizer was amazing, and the Korean chicken was very nicely spiced.  The Hamachi crudo was also excellent.  Service was spotty - our entrees arrived while we were still eating our entrées despite the fact that we explicitly asked our waitress to appropriately space the courses. Plates were cleared even though 3 members of our party were still eating, an appetizer was totally overlooked, and the server only had basic knowledge of the wine list, which was oddly concocted and overpriced. The best description of the entrees is that the chef is trying too hard to make disparate elements work together and it falls short.  The lamb shank, though beautifully presented and cooked, was bland and badly in need of salt.  The river trout was dry while the accompanying squash hush puppies were quite good. The squid ink risotto was bland with an odd texture.  The duck breast was overcooked and dry despite requesting it medium rare.  We ordered an Amaro after dinner drink and received bourbon.  Although the bartender apologized for the error there was no effort on the part of the restaurant to address this and the other errors that should not have occurred with a restaurant of Aurum’s caliber."

I had the pork roulade, which was superb, preceded by their squash soup.  My wife had the trout, with the Brussels sprouts appetizer, which were also excellent.  Great cocktails (Smoked Old Fashioned and a Bees Knees), too.  Aurum’s consistent excellence is the reason we keep going back to Aurum, which is our favorite restaurant in Breck."

While I thought our hamachi crudo was slightly fishy, the accouterments were spicy enough to make it enjoyable and the other dishes we ordered:  arugula/romaine caesar salad and rainbow trout and pork entrees, all were outstanding, so I still gave an outstanding rating on the food. While our main server was super nice, let me have a taste of wine before ordering, he was a little inconsistent and forgetful when it came time to bringing the food.  And the only reason I mention that is because it is a pretty upscale place price-wise so the service should match.  Regardless, it was still a great experience, loved the ambiance, food, as well as our friendly and eccentric waiter!  Definitely would go back and recommend!"

Reservations are a must for dinner, but they always manage to accommodate our special requests, whether they be food allergies or table preferences.  This most recent time, we had the trout and lamb shank entrees, with a Caesar salad and Korean chicken appetizers to start.  All were excellent.  I have to give a shout-out to the bartenders, who made us some excellent classic cocktails (Bees Knees and Aviation), and they, too, were superb, well-balanced, flavorful, and nicely presented.  Service was excellent, as usual, and the owner was busy checking up on everybody, when he wasn’t pouring wine or otherwise attending to other details.  His and other managers hands-on involvement, together with an excellent kitchen and bar staff, could be the secret to Aurum’s success.  The staff are all very well-trained and work as a team to make every diner’s experience the best it can be."

We began with an apricot cucumber gazpacho. Very creative and very fresh.  We had the rotating pasta dish, which was delish! A traditional bolognese on a handmade pumpkin seed pesto pasta. We ended with the Asian style lamb shank. Very good and enough that we had to take leftovers with us. Highly recommend."

I expect a lot of people will like it a lot, and a few folks will walk away scratching their heads and wondering who the chef is trying to please.\nA caveat: we didn't order from the Mains section of the menu; we just weren't hungry enough to do so. \nI started with the smoked old fashioned, which was good but not the best of its breed. (Go to Ambli in Denver for that.)\nWe ordered the elote \"ribs\" appetizer -- a clever, fun and tasty twist on corn on the cob -- and a couple of items off the Small Plates menu. Caron had the ceviche, and I had the French onion burger. The ceviche was not at all your traditional Mexican ceviche, and after we'd both tried it, we agreed that it did not represent an improvement. The burger was large and tasty, cooked to order and accompanied by fries. Anywhere but 2019 Breckenridge it would be difficult to justify the $20 price tag.\nWe split a creme brule for dessert. I thought it was well done (and pleasantly devoid of any quirk for the sake of \"creativity\") but Caron was less impressed.\nThe ambience is, evidently, aimed at someone else. The service was outstanding throughout.\nI gave four stars overall because, without ordering off the Mains menu, we may not have truly given the place a real opportunity to shine."

We especially loved the beef tartar, the fries, and the Caesar salads.  Service was great; she even came around and gave us one more chance to order more before happy hour ended.  Also, one of our group has Celiac, and they had lots of gluten free options, including the fries, cooked in a separate fryer!  It was a real treat for her."

Apparently they were missing artichoke hearts which I thought could've been delivered within minutes from one of the local grocers in the area that offer delivery services. (Everything else was a meat dish on the menu besides appetizers.)\n\nWe elected to move our reservation elsewhere because of the menu snafu and they were very apologetic and picked up the tab on our round of cocktails which was a nice gesture. People and service was friendly otherwise, but seemed like they could've been better prepared since they have a limited menu to start with.... or at least could've made an order for grocery delivery to alleviate losing a $200+ tab."

The cauliflower was very good as was the maple snow crab starter. Then there was the main dish: duck confit... \n\nIt is the best single dish I have had in my adult life. \n\nI have eaten at many more expensive and “star/macaron” decorated restaurants (including those where ladies’ handbags get their own chairs) and have not experienced a dish that I have enjoyed so much. The presentation was nice—on a dark plate no less—but it is the varied flavor profiles that won me over. Depending on the trajectory of the fork you would pick up multiple combinations of duck meat, crispy skin, root vegetables, purée, etc....all bound together with the comforting soy jus.\n\nThe dessert was clever: Small chocolate chip cookies made to order with a mini whisk covered in dough to remind you of being a kid and Mom letting you lick the spoon.\n\nMatch this with nice ambiance, attentive staff and the cold evenings common in Breckenridge and you have the ultimate comfort food experience in my opinion."

And as a matter of fact, we were (quietly, in whispers) steered here by the hostess at another Breckenridge restaurant when that place was totally booked for the evening.   Wow, did she ever do us a favor!  Everything single thing we had was over the top outstanding, from the whiskey and wine all the way through dessert.  We had awesome recommendations from staff (not just our own server, who btw was fantastic!), all of which were excellent.  I ordered the ahi special, served over white bean puree and other ingredients I can't even remember, but all of which came together in one tasty dish.  My husband had trout with capers, brown butter, etc., and all but licked the plate clean.  Then, although we don't normally eat dessert, we couldn't resist ordering the sticky cake-something-something...omg delicious!  Seriously, I'd go back to Breck just to eat here : )"

Only negatives were the ceviche from the raw bar could have used a couple of crackers and the crab shared plate was a bit overpriced for the small amount of crab that we received (Our server did tell us it was only 6 ozs.). Our favorites were definitely the meatballs and Korean fried chicken. \n\nThis is a new and fantastic add to the Breckenridge community.  You owe it to yourself to check them out."

They couldn't have been more accommodating, showing us to a table in the main dining room.  Food as always was tremendous; my wife ordered the Bib Wedge Salad and Roasted Squash Risotto.

They put us at an accessible table in the main dining room. We started with the brussel sprouts, which were excellent. I had the salmon special, very good. My mom had the trout and loved it. We had the profiteroles for desert, which were off the mark, sadly. The pastry was like a dry biscuit and there was a hazelnut sugar decoration on top (very beautiful)  which didn't melt and it produced sharp shards in the mouth. The waiters were really attentive, which is rare for this town! Overall, this is my new favorite place in Breckenridge. We've also been for happy hour, which is nice. We love the bar tender and the decor is bright & cheery. I highly recommend!"

I recommend getting it—creamy and full of flavor. For our entrees, I had the risotto and it may have been the best risotto I’ve ever eaten.

My husband has several allergies and our waitress could not have done more to find a number of great options that would work for him.  Several people stopped by to see how we were doing, not enough to be a bother, and it was nice to meet their manager.  We had such a lovely time that we went back two days later before leaving town.  The only complaint we had was the noise level when the place filled up but we understand they are working to resolve that.  By the way, their décor is fresh and relaxing.  We'll definitely return."

They were cooked to perfection—crispy outside and fluffy inside. We capped off the meal with the upside down peach cake—again, it’s rare I can find gluten free cake on a menu and this was yummy, served with vanilla Ice cream & warm milk with the occasional tiny surprise of brittle and candied ginger.

With that said, the flavors were interesting -- not anything that said \"wow!\" per se, but there is a great mix of fusion flavor on this menu that would satisfy almost any palate.  The beef tartare flavor was reminiscent of a sloppy joe which is odd for a higher end restaurant. The Korean fried chicken dish was spicy, yet very tasty - the pickles were a nice addition to flavor here. Our entrees were *very* good, yet small. The cocktails were excellent and priced accordingly.  There were two duck confits and a filet at the table - all plates cleaned. Dessert was something I would skip in the future and perhaps replace with another shared plate. I liked this restaurant, but was not overly wowed by it. With a few drinks, expect to dish out about $100/person with gratuity. This is a bit hard to swallow for a mountain town that cannot necessarily be renowned for its dining options. Additionally, it is pretty loud in here, so expect to speak up in conversation."

The restaurant was built from scratch in one of the few formerly vacant lots in Breck, and the building is light, airy, and has a great vibe.  The servers were happy, attentive and helpful to all patrons and accommodated food allergies very well. The owner and the manager are very hands-on and asked about our meal.  They have an excellent wine list, and both traditional and specialty cocktails  which were terrific.  The food was superb, with a diverse offering with original twists.  Go there early to take advantage of happy hour pricing on some food, wine and cocktails.   \n\nOverall, the attention to detail in every aspect really sets it apart.  Breckenridge has some truly great restaurants, and Aurum sits very near, if not at, the top of my list.  If you are anywhere  in Summit County, you owe it to yourself to check it out."

Food was so great!  the menu was exactly the same and we had to have that Korean Chicken again along with the French Onion Burger but when they threw in the Parker house rolls with the butter...oh that butter....who is making this stuff!  It was so great!  We tried the Buttermilk Ricotta Cheese dish for the first time and it is super.  I am back home in Northern Colorado right now but if they ever fixed the roads here I might just drive up tonight!   The people are the added extra of so much fun to be around you want to just go back and wash the dishes.   What a great place, we will be back soon!"

We had a waitress, Chelsea that we couldn't tip enough to reward her for great service!  A vivacious young lady, she kept and eye on everything and everyone, funny,  great lady....and the food is clean, wholesome, perfect menu...just enough to give you a choice but not so much that they can't make it all to perfection in the back...whoever the chef is, isn't paid enough as the presentation and the taste of every meal was perfect...we are here for three nights from Fort Collins on a getaway with my lovely wife and we just stumbled onto this restaurant two nights ago, and went back last night and are going tonight!   We have never done this before!  The upside down peach desert was the greatest, if only it had two scoops of ice cream instead of one, I would have fallen out of my chair with happiness!  Kale Salad, great!  had it both nights!  Korean Fried Chicken last night...wow!!! crispy, spicy, not too spicy!    French Onion Burger, both nights....they figured out how to cook it just as I ordered it ..and melt the cheese to perfection!  Everyone go there...we will be there tonight"

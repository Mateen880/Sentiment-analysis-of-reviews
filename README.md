🍽️ Restaurant Review Analysis & Competitor Insights – Python Project
A complete end-to-end pipeline that scrapes restaurant reviews from OpenTable, extracts structured insights using LLMs, and presents an interactive dashboard for competitor analysis with time-series visualizations.

🚀 Features
🔍 Automated Web Scraping
Scrapes reviews, ratings, and dates from OpenTable using Selenium and BeautifulSoup, with full pagination support.

🧾 Structured Review Extraction
Extracts key data: restaurant names, user reviews, star ratings, and timestamps.

🧠 LLM-Powered Prompt Analysis
Uses prompt engineering to extract meaningful food and staff-related feedback from raw text reviews.

🔐 Privacy-Preserving Text Handling
Automatically removes personally identifiable information (PII) from user content.

📊 Interactive Visualization Dashboard
Built with Streamlit or Flask, featuring:

Color-coded comments for food vs. staff insights

A complete pipeline project in Python that scrapes restaurant reviews from OpenTable, extracts structured insights using LLM-based prompt engineering, visualizes results via a GUI, and performs competitor analysis using time-series data.

ðŸš€ Features

Web scraping using Selenium & BeautifulSoup with full pagination support

Structured extraction of restaurant name, reviews, ratings, and dates

Prompt-based analysis of reviews to extract food and staff-related comments

Removal of personal identifiable information (PII)

Interactive dashboard (built in Streamlit/Flask) for review visualization

Color-coded display of food vs staff feedback

Competitor analysis with rating trends and time-series graphs

ðŸ›  Technologies Used

Python

BeautifulSoup & Selenium (for web scraping)

OpenAI API / LLMs (for prompt engineering)

Pandas, JSON, CSV (for data processing)

Streamlit / Flask (for GUI dashboard)

Matplotlib / Plotly (for visualization)

ðŸ§  Concepts Practiced

This project was part of an AI / Data Analysis course and applies several real-world concepts:

Web automation and data collection using scraping tools

Prompt engineering and secure LLM usage (avoiding hallucinations + PII)

JSON/CSV data handling for structured outputs

Full-stack GUI integration for search and review highlight

Time-series comparison for business insights
